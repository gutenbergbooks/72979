<h2><a id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Mr. Pinner</span> was a God-fearing man, who was afraid of everything except
respectability. He married Mrs. Pinner when they were both twenty, and
by the time they were both thirty if he had had to do it again he
wouldn’t have. For Mrs. Pinner had several drawbacks. One was, she
quarrelled; and Mr. Pinner, who prized peace, was obliged to quarrel
too. Another was, she appeared to be unable to have children; and Mr.
Pinner, who was fond of children, accordingly couldn’t have them either.
And another, which while it lasted was in some ways the worst, was that
she was excessively pretty.</p>

<p>This was most awkward in a shop. It continually put Mr. Pinner in false
positions. And it seemed to go on so long. There seemed to be no end to
the years of Mrs. Pinner’s prettiness. They did end, however; and when
she was about thirty-five, worn out by her own unquiet spirit and the
work of helping Mr. Pinner in the shop, as well as keeping house for
him, which included doing everything single-handed, by God’s mercy she
at last began to fade.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner was pleased. For though her behaviour had been beyond
criticism, and she had invariably, by a system of bridling and
head-tossing, kept off familiarity on the part of male customers, still
those customers had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_2">{2}</a></span> undoubtedly been more numerous than the others, and
Mr. Pinner hadn’t liked it. It was highly unnatural, he knew, for
gentlemen on their way home from their offices to wish to buy rice, for
instance, when it had been bought earlier in the day by their wives or
mothers. There was something underhand about it; and he, who being timid
was also honest, found himself not able to be happy if there were a
shadow of doubt in his mind as to the honourableness of any of his
transactions. He never got used to these purchases, and was glad when
the gradual disappearance of his wife’s beauty caused the gradual
disappearance of the customers who made them. Money, it was true, was
lost, but he preferred to lose it than to make it by means that verged
in his opinion on shady.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Pinner faded and custom dropped off, he and she had more time on
their hands, and went to bed earlier; for Mrs. Pinner, who had an
untiring tongue when she was awake, and inveigled her husband into many
quarrels, was obliged to leave off talking when she was asleep, and he,
pretending it was because of the gas bills, got her to go to bed earlier
and earlier. Besides, he wished more heartily than ever that she might
have a child, if only to take her attention off him. But he longed for a
child himself as well, for he was affectionate without passion, and it
was his secret opinion&mdash;all his opinions were secret, because if he let
them out Mrs. Pinner quarrelled&mdash;that such men are born good fathers.
Something, however, had to be born besides themselves before they could
show their capabilities, and Mrs. Pinner, who was passionate without
affection, which in Mr. Pinner’s opinion was rather shocking, for she
sometimes quite frightened him in bed, and he was sure it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">{3}</a></span> wasn’t at all
respectable for a wife to do that, especially as next day she didn’t
seem to like him any better than before, hadn’t been able to produce
what was needed.</p>

<p>Certain it was that he couldn’t become a father without her. In this one
thing he depended utterly on her; for though she believed she ruled him
through and through, in every other matter at the back of his soul Mr.
Pinner always secretly managed very well for himself. But here he was
helpless. If she didn’t, he couldn’t. Nothing doing at all without Mrs.
Pinner.</p>

<p>Therefore, as a first step, every evening at nine o’clock, instead of at
eleven or twelve as had been their habit in the busy, tiring years,
after a day of only too much leisure they went to bed. There they
tossed, because of its being so early; or, rather, Mrs. Pinner tossed,
while he lay quiet, such being his nature. And whether it was these
regular hours, or whether it was God, who favours families, at last
taking pity on the Pinners, just as Mr. Pinner was coming to the
conclusion that he had best perhaps now let well alone, for he and his
wife were drawing near forty, Mrs. Pinner inexplicably began to do that
which she ought to have done twenty years earlier, and proceeded to go
through those bodily changes, one after the other and all strictly
according to precedent, which were bound to end, though for many months
Mr. Pinner didn’t believe it, in either a boy or a girl; or
perhaps&mdash;this was his secret longing&mdash;in both.</p>

<p>They ended in one girl.</p>

<p>‘I’m blest,’ said Mr. Pinner to himself, seeing his wife’s complete,
impassioned absorption, ‘if that kid ain’t goin’ to be my salvation.’</p>

<p>And he wanted to have it christened Salvation, but Mrs. Pinner objected,
because it wasn’t a girl’s name<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span> at all, she said; and, as she had no
heart just then for quarrelling, they compromised on Salvatia.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Thus was Salvatia projected into the world, who afterwards became Sally.
Her parents struggled against her being called Sally, because they
thought it common. Their struggles, however, were vain. People were
unteachable. And the child herself, from the moment she could talk,
persisted in saying she was Sally.</p>

<p>She grew up so amazingly pretty that it soon became the Pinners’ chief
concern how best to hide her. Such beauty, which began by being their
pride, quickly became their anxiety. By the time Sally was twelve they
were always hiding her. She was quite easy to hide, for she went meekly
where she was told and stayed there, having not only inherited her
father’s mild goodness, but also, partly from him and more from some
unknown forbear, for she had much more of it than Mr. Pinner at his most
obliging, a great desire to give satisfaction and do what was asked of
her. She had none of that artfulness of the weak that was so marked a
feature of Mr. Pinner. She never was different at the back of her mind
from what she was on the surface of her behaviour. Life hadn’t yet
forced her, as it had forced Mr. Pinner, to be secretive; it hadn’t had
time. Besides, said Mr. Pinner to himself, she wasn’t married.</p>

<p>From her mother she had inherited nothing but her looks; translating,
however, the darkness into fairness, and the prettiness into
beauty,&mdash;beauty authentic, indisputable, apparent to the most
unobservant. Mr. Pinner was divided between pride and fear. Mrs. Pinner
concentrated entirely on her child, and was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span> best of prudent
mothers. There, in their back parlour, they kept this secret treasure,
and, like other treasures, its possession produced anxiety as well as
joy. Till she was about twelve she did as other children, and went off
to school by herself every day, illuminating Islington, as she passed
along its streets, like a flame. Then the Pinners got a fright: she was
followed. Not once or twice, but several times; and came home one day
happy, her hands full of chocolates she said a gentleman had given her.</p>

<p>The Pinners began to hide her. Mrs. Pinner took her to school and
fetched her away again every day, and in between hid her in the back
parlour. Mr. Pinner did Mrs. Pinner’s work as well as his own while she
was gone, and just managed to because his wife was fleet of foot and ran
most of the way; otherwise it would have broken his back, for he wasn’t
able to afford to keep an assistant, and had little staying power. At
night, when the dear object of their love and fear was asleep, they
earnestly in bed discussed what was best to be done so as to secure to
her the greatest happiness together with the greatest safety. Their
common care and love had harmonised them. In the child they were
completely at one. No longer did Mrs. Pinner rail, and Mr. Pinner, after
a time, be obliged to answer back; no longer was he forced, contrary to
his nature, into quarrels. Peace prevailed, and the affection that comes
from a common absorbing interest.</p>

<p>‘It’s all that there Sally,’ said Mr. Pinner, content at last in his
married life, and unable&mdash;for he had few words&mdash;to put what he felt more
glowingly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>But when Sally was sixteen Mrs. Pinner died; died in a few days, of a
cold no worse than dozens of colds she had caught in her life and hadn’t
died of.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner was left with no one to help him, either in his shop or with
Sally. It was an immense misfortune. He didn’t know which way to turn.
He lived within the narrowest margin of safety, for in Islington there
were many grocers, and he was one of the very smallest, never having had
any ambition beyond the ambition for peace and enough to eat.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to run the shop without help, and without the
shop he and Sally would starve, so there was nothing for it but to let
her take her mother’s place; and within a week his custom was doubled,
and went on doubling and doubling till the local supply of males was
exhausted.</p>

<p>It was a repetition of twenty years earlier, only much worse. Mr. Pinner
was most unhappy. Sally couldn’t help smiling back when anybody smiled
at her,&mdash;it was her nature; and as everybody, the minute they saw her,
did smile, she was in a continual condition of radiance, and the shop
seemed full of light. Mr. Pinner was distracted. He hired an assistant,
having made money, announced that his daughter had gone away to
boarding-school, and hid her in the back parlour. The custom dropped
off, and the assistant had to go. Out came Sally again, and back came
the custom. What a situation, thought Mr. Pinner, irritable and
perspiring. He was worn out keeping his eye on Sally, and weighing out
coffee and bacon at the same time. His responsibilities crushed him. The
only solution of his difficulties would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_7">{7}</a></span> be to get the girl married to
some steady fellow able to take care of her. There seemed to him to be
no steady fellows in the crowd in his shop, except the ones who were
already married, and they couldn’t really be steady or they wouldn’t be
there. How could a married man be called steady who eagerly waited for
Sally to sell him groceries he would only afterwards have to conceal
from his wife? While as for the rest, they were a weedy lot of
overworked and underpaid young clerks who couldn’t possibly afford to
marry. Sally smiled at them all. She had none of the bridling, of the
keep-off-the-grass-<i>if</i>-you-please, of her mother.</p>

<p>‘For mercy’s sake,’ Mr. Pinner would hiss in her ear, tugging her elbow
as he hurried past, ‘don’t go keepin’ on makin’ pleasant faces at ’em
like that.’</p>

<p>But what faces was she to make, then? All Sally’s faces were pleasant
from the point of view of the beholder, whatever sort she made; and if
she, by a great effort, and contrary to her nature, frowned at anybody,
as likely as not she would be gaped at harder than ever, and asked if
she wouldn’t mind doing that again.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner was distracted. Even the clergy came to his shop,&mdash;came with
breezy tales of being henpecked, and driven out by tyrant wives to
purchase currants; and even the doctor came,&mdash;old enough surely, Mr.
Pinner thought, to be ashamed of himself, running after a girl he had
himself brought into the world, and pretending that what he was after
was biscuits.</p>

<p>What he was after was, very plainly, not biscuits, nor were the clergy
after currants. One and all were after Sally. And it horrified Mr.
Pinner, who took round the plate on Sundays, that a child of his, so
good and modest, should be the innocent cause of producing in the
hearts<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span> of her fellow-creatures a desire to sin. That they desired to
sin was only too evident to Mr. Pinner, driven by fear to the basest
suspicions. These married gentlemen&mdash;what could it be but sin they had
in their minds? They wished to sin with Sally, to sin the sin of sins;
with his Sally, his spotless lamb, a child of God, an inheritor of the
kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>For a year Mr. Pinner endured it, struggling with his responsibilities
and his black suspicions. The milk of his natural kindliness and respect
for his betters went sour. He grew to hate the gentry. His face took on
a twist of fear that became permanent. The other grocers were furious
with him, accusing him among themselves of using his daughter as a
decoy; and unable to bear this, for it of course got round to him, and
worn out by the constant dread lest worse were yet to come, and some
fine day a young whipper-snapper of a lord should be going for a walk in
Islington and chance to stroll into his shop and see Sally, and then
good-bye to virtue&mdash;for was any girl good enough and modest enough to
stand out against the onslaughts of a lord? Mr. Pinner asked himself,
who had never consciously come across any lords, and therefore was apt
to think of them highly&mdash;Mr. Pinner determined to move.</p>

<p>He moved. After several Sundays given up to fruitless and ill-organised
excursions into other suburbs, he heard by chance of a village buried
far away in what seemed to him, whose England consisted of Hampstead
Heath, Hampton Court, and, once, Southend, a savage and uninhabited
district in Cambridgeshire, where the man who kept its one shop was
weary of solitude, and wanted to come nearer London. What could be
nearer London than London itself? Mr. Pinner hurried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span> Woodles,
leaving Sally under the strictest vows not to put her terribly
complicating nose out of doors.</p>

<p>He thought he had never seen such a place. Used to streets and crowds,
he couldn’t have believed there were spots in the world so empty. It was
raining, and there wasn’t a soul about. A few cottages, the shop, a
church and vicarage, and a sad wet pig grunting along a ditch,&mdash;that was
all. Three miles from a branch-line station, embedded in a network of
muddy lanes, and the Vicar&mdash;Mr. Pinner inquired&mdash;seventy-eight with no
sons, Woodles was surely the ideal place for him and Sally. Over a
bottle of ginger beer he made friends with the shopkeeper, and arranged
that he should come up to Islington with a view to exchanging. He came;
and the exchange, after some regrettable incidents in connection with
Sally which very nearly upset the whole thing, was made, and by
Christmas Islington knew the Pinners no more.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>All went well at Woodles for the first few weeks. It was a hamlet, Mr.
Pinner rejoiced to discover, lived in practically exclusively by ladies.
These ladies, attracted to it by the tumbledownness of its cottages,
which made it both picturesque and cheap, had either never had husbands
or had lost them, and accordingly, as so often happens in such
circumstances, were poor. Well, Mr. Pinner didn’t mind that. He only
wanted to live. He had no desire to make more than was just necessary to
feed Sally. More merely meant responsibility and bother, and of those he
had as much as he could do with because of Sally. He settled down, very
content and safe among his widow and virgin customers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span> and spent a
thankful Christmas, entering with hope into the New Year.</p>

<p>Then, one day towards the end of January, two young men rent the peace
of the sunny afternoon with the unpleasant noise motor-bicycles, rushing
at high speed, appear, Mr. Pinner thought, kindly even towards these,
not to be able to help making, and a lady customer who chanced to be in
the shop remarked, ‘It has begun.’</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner inquired politely what had begun, and the lady said term had,
and Mr. Pinner, who didn’t know what she meant but was unwilling to show
his ignorance, said, ‘And high time too.’</p>

<p>After that, hardly an afternoon went by without young men hurrying
through Woodles. Sometimes they were on motor-bicycles, sometimes they
were on horses, sometimes they were in cars, but always they hurried.
Where did they all come from? Mr. Pinner was astonished, and wondered
uneasily whether Sally were not somehow at the bottom of it. But she
couldn’t have been, for they never so much as glanced at the shop
window, from behind whose jars of bulls’-eyes and mounds of toffee he
and Sally secretly observed them.</p>

<p>Then, gradually, he became aware of Cambridge. He hadn’t given it a
thought when he came to Woodles. It was ten miles away&mdash;a place, he
knew, where toffs were taught, but a place ten miles away hadn’t worried
him. There he had changed, on that first visit, for the branch-line that
took him within three miles of Woodles, and the village, asleep beneath
its blanket of rain, had been entirely deserted, the last word in dank
and misty isolation. And when he moved in, it was still asleep&mdash;asleep,
this time, in the silence of the Christmas vacation, and only faintly
stirred every now and again<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span> by the feeble movements of unmated ladies.
It was so much out of the way that if it hadn’t been for Cambridge it
would have slept for ever. But young men are restless and get
everywhere. Bursting with energy, they rushed through Woodles as they
rushed through all places within rushable distance. But they rushed,
they didn’t stop; and Mr. Pinner consoled himself with that, and also
with the knowledge he presently acquired that it was only for a few
months&mdash;weeks, one might almost say, in the year, that this happened.</p>

<p>He bade Sally keep indoors during the afternoon hours, and hoped for the
best.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Then, on a gusty afternoon in early March, when the mud in the lanes had
turned to dust and was tearing in clouds down the street, the door
opened violently, because of the wind, and a young man was blown in, and
had to use all his strength to get the door shut again.</p>

<p>No sound of a motor had preceded him; he appeared just as one of the
ladies might have appeared; and Sally was in the shop.</p>

<p>She was on some steps, rummaging aloft among the tins of Huntley and
Palmer, and he didn’t immediately see her, and addressed himself to Mr.
Pinner.</p>

<p>‘Have you any petrol?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ said Mr. Pinner quickly, hoping he would go away at once
without noticing Sally. ‘We don’t keep it.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know where I can&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>The young man broke off, and stood staring upwards. ‘Christ’&mdash;he
whispered under his breath, ‘Christ&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Now, now,’ said Mr. Pinner with extreme irritability,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span> only too well
aware of what had happened, and in his fear slapping his knuckly little
hand on the counter, ‘no blasphemy ’ere, sir, if <i>you</i> please&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But he needn’t have been so angry and frightened, for this, if he had
only known it, was his future son-in-law; the person who was to solve
all his problems by taking over the responsibility of Sally. In a word
it was, as Mr. Pinner ever afterwards described him, Mr. Luke.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">{13}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">At</span> the date when he went into the shop at Woodles in search of petrol,
young Luke, whose Christian name was Jocelyn, was a youth of parts, with
an inventive and inquiring brain, and a thirst some of his friends at
Ananias were unable to account for after knowledge. His bent was
scientific; his tastes were chemical. He wished to weigh and compare, to
experiment and prove. For this a quiet, undisturbed life was necessary,
in which day after day he could work steadily and without interruption.
What he had hoped for was to get a fellowship at Ananias. Instead, he
got Sally.</p>

<p>It was clear to Jocelyn, considering his case later, that the matter
with him at this time was youth. Nature had her eye on him. However much
he wished to use his brains, and devote himself to the pursuit of
scientific truth, she wished to use the rest of him, and she did. He had
been proof against every other temptation she had plied him with, but he
wasn’t proof against Sally; and all the things he had thought, and
hoped, and been interested in up to then, seemed, directly he saw Sally,
dross. A fever of desire to secure this marvel before any one else
discovered her sent him almost out of his mind. He was scorched by
passion, racked by fear. He knew he was no good at all from the marriage
point<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span> of view, for he had no money hardly, and was certain he would be
refused, and then&mdash;what then?</p>

<p>He need not have been afraid. At the word marriage Mr. Pinner, who had
been snarling at him on his visits like an old dog who has been hurt and
suspects everybody, nearly fell on his neck. Sally was in the back
parlour. He had sent her there at once every time young Luke appeared in
the shop, and then faced the young man defiantly, leaning with both
hands on the counter, looking up at him with all his weak little
bristles on end, and inquiring of him angrily, ‘Now what can I do for
you to-<i>day</i>, sir?’</p>

<p>At the end of a week of this, Jocelyn, wild with fear lest the other
inhabitants of the colleges of Cambridge, so perilously close for cars
and bicycles, should discover and carry the girl off before he did,
proposed through Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>‘I want to marry your daughter,’ he stammered, his tongue dry, his eyes
burning. ‘I must see her. I must talk&mdash;just to find out if she thinks
she wouldn’t mind. It’s absurd, simply absurd, never to let me say a
word to her&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And Mr. Pinner, instead of pushing him out of the shop as Jocelyn,
knowing his own poverty, expected, nearly fell on his neck.</p>

<p>‘Marry her? You did say marry, didn’t you, sir?’ he said in a trembling
voice, flushing right up to his worried, kind blue eyes.</p>

<p>He could scarcely believe that he heard right. This young gentleman&mdash;a
car, and all&mdash;nothing against him as far as he could see, and he hoped
he could see as far as most people, except his youth.... But if he
hadn’t been so young he mightn’t so badly have wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span> marry Sally,
Mr. Pinner told himself, his eyes, now full of respect and awe, on the
eager face of the suitor, for from experience he knew that everybody had
wanted to do something badly with Sally, but it had hardly ever been
marriage.</p>

<p>‘If your intentions is honourable&mdash;&mdash;’ began Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>‘Honourable! Good God. As though&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Now, now, sir,’ interrupted Mr. Pinner gently, holding up a deprecating
hand, ‘no need to get swearing. No need at <i>all</i>.’</p>

<p>‘No, no&mdash;of course not. I beg your pardon. But I must see her&mdash;I must be
able to talk to her&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Exactly, sir. Step inside,’ said Mr. Pinner, opening the door to the
back room.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>There sat Sally, mending in the lamplight.</p>

<p>‘We got a visitor,’ said Mr. Pinner, excited and proud. ‘But I’m blest,
sir,’ he added, turning to Jocelyn, ‘if I knows what to call you.’</p>

<p>‘Luke&mdash;Jocelyn Luke,’ murmured the young man as one in a dream, his eyes
on Sally.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Luke,’ introduced Mr. Pinner, pleased, for the name smacked
agreeably of evangelists. ‘And Salvatia is ’er name, ain’t it, Salvatia?
’Er baptismal name, any’ow,’ he added, because of the way Sally was
looking at him. ‘Sometimes people calls ’er Sally, but there ain’t no
<i>need</i> to, Mr. Luke&mdash;there ain’t no <i>need</i> to at all, sir. Get another
cup, will you, Salvatia?&mdash;and let’s ’ave our tea.’</p>

<p>And while she was getting the cup out of some back scullery place,
wondering at suddenly becoming Salvatia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> her father whispered to the
suitor, ‘You go a’ead, sir, when she come back, and don’t mind me.’</p>

<p>Jocelyn didn’t mind him, for he forgot him the instant Sally reappeared,
but he couldn’t go ahead. He sat dumb, gaping. The girl was too
exquisite. She was beauty itself. From the top of her little head, with
its flame-coloured hair and broad low brow and misty eyes like brown
amber, down along the slender lines of her delicate body to where her
small feet were thrust into shabby shoes, she was, surely, perfect. He
could see no flaw. She seemed to light up the room. It was like, thought
young Luke, for the first time in the presence of real beauty, suddenly
being shown God. He wanted to cry. His mouth, usually so firmly shut,
quivered. He sat dumb. So that it was Mr. Pinner who did what talking
there was, for Sally, of the class whose womenfolk do not talk when the
father brings in a friend to tea, said nothing.</p>

<p>Her part was to pour out the tea; and this she did gravely, her
eyelashes, which just to see was to long to kiss, lying duskily on her
serious face. She was serious because the visitor hadn’t yet smiled at
her, so she hadn’t been able to smile back, and Jocelyn accordingly
didn’t yet know about her smile; and Mr. Pinner, flushed with
excitement, afraid it couldn’t be really true, sure at the same time
that it was, entertained the suitor as best he could, making little
jokes intended to put him at his ease and encourage him to go ahead,
while at the same time trying to convey to Sally, by frowns and nods,
that if she chose to make pleasant faces at this particular young
gentleman she had his permission to do so.</p>

<p>The suitor, however, remained silent, and Sally obtuse. Her father had
never behaved like this before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span> and she had no idea what it was all
about. It was hard work for one, like Mr. Pinner, unaccustomed to social
situations requiring tact and experience, and he perspired. He was
relieved when his daughter cleared away the tea and went off with it
into the scullery to wash up, leaving him alone with his young guest,
who sat, his head sunk on his breast, following the girl with his eyes
till the door was shut on her. Then, turning to her father, his thin
face working with agitation, he began to pour out the whole tale of his
terrible unworthiness and undesirability.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ere,’ said Mr. Pinner, pushing a tin of the best tobacco he stocked
towards his upset visitor, ‘light up, won’t you, sir?’</p>

<p>The young man took no notice of the tobacco, and Mr. Pinner, listening
attentively to all he was pouring out, couldn’t for the life of him see
where the undesirability and unworthiness came in.</p>

<p>‘She’s a good girl,’ said Mr. Pinner, not filling his pipe either, from
politeness, ‘as good a girl as ever trod this earth. And what I always
say is that no good man is unworthy of the goodest girl. That’s right,
ain’t it? Got to be good, of course. Beg pardon, sir, but might I ask&mdash;’
he sank his voice to a whisper, glancing at the scullery door&mdash;‘if
you’re a <i>good</i> man, sir? I should say, gentleman. It’s a ticklish
question to ’ave to ask, I know, sir, but ’er mother would ’ave
wished&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I don’t drink, I don’t bet, and I’m not tangled up with any woman,’
said Jocelyn. ‘I suppose that’s what you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Then where’s all this ’ere undesirable come in?’ inquired Mr. Pinner,
puzzled.</p>

<p>‘I’m poor,’ said the suitor briefly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Poor. That’s bad,’ agreed Mr. Pinner, shaking his head and screwing up
his mouth. He knew all about being poor. He had had, first and last, his
bellyful of that.</p>

<p>And yet on being questioned, as Mr. Pinner felt bound in duty to
question, it turned out that the young gentleman was very well off
indeed. He had £500 a year certain, whatever he did or didn’t do, and to
Mr. Pinner, used to counting in pennies, this not only seemed enough to
keep a wife and family in comfort, but also in style.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Sally came back, and Mr. Pinner, inspired, lifted a finger, said ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ark,’
gave them to understand he heard a customer, without actually saying he
did, which would have been a lie, and went away into the shop.</p>

<p>Sally stood there, feeling awkward. Jocelyn had got up directly she came
in, and she supposed he was going to wish her a good evening and go; but
he didn’t. She therefore stood first on one foot and then on the other,
and felt awkward.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you,’ Jocelyn breathed, stretching out a hand of trembling
entreaty, for he was afraid she might disappear again, ‘won’t you sit
down?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Sally shyly, ‘I don’t mind if I do&mdash;&mdash;’ And for the first
time Jocelyn heard the phrase he was later on to hear so often, uttered
in the accent he was to try so hard to purify.</p>

<p>She sat down on the edge of the chair at the other side of the table.
She wasn’t accustomed to sitting idle and didn’t know what to do with
her hands, but she was sure it wouldn’t be manners to go on mending
socks while a gentleman was in the room.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span></p>

<p>Jocelyn sat down too, the table between them, the light from the oil
lamp hanging from the ceiling beating down on Sally’s head.</p>

<p>‘And Beauty was made flesh, and dwelt among us,’ he murmured, his eyes
burning.</p>

<p>‘Pardon?’ said Sally, polite, but wishing her father would come back.</p>

<p>‘You lovely thing&mdash;you lovely, lovely thing,’ whispered Jocelyn
hoarsely, his eyes like coals of fire.</p>

<p>At this Sally became thoroughly uneasy, and looked at him in real alarm.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be frightened. Your father knows. He says I may&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Father?’ she repeated, much surprised.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes&mdash;I asked him. He says I may. He says I may&mdash;may talk to you,
make friends with you. That is,’ stammered Jocelyn, overcome by her
loveliness, ‘if you’ll let me&mdash;oh, if you’ll let me....’</p>

<p>Sally was astonished at her father. ‘Well I never did,’ she murmured
courteously. ‘Fancy father.’</p>

<p>‘Why? Why? Don’t you want to? Won’t you&mdash;don’t you want to?’</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t say <i>that</i>,’ said Sally, shifting in her chair, and struggling
to find the polite words. ‘Wouldn’t exactly say as ’ow I don’t <i>want</i>
to.’</p>

<p>‘Then you&mdash;you’ll let me take you out? You’ll let me take you somewhere
to tea? You’ll let me fetch you in the car&mdash;you’ll let me, won’t you?
To-morrow?’ asked Jocelyn, leaning further across the table, his arms
stretched along it towards her, reaching out to her in entreaty.</p>

<p>‘Father&mdash;&mdash;’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span></p>
<p>‘But he says I may. It’s with his permission&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Tea too?’ asked Sally, more and more astonished. ‘It ain’t much <i>like</i>
’im,’ she said, full of doubts.</p>

<p>Whereupon Jocelyn got up impetuously, and came round to her with the
intention of flinging himself at her feet, and on his knees beseeching
her to come out with him&mdash;he who in his life had never been on his knees
to anybody.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Salvatia!’ he cried, coming round to her, holding out both his
hands.</p>

<p>She hastily pushed back her chair and slipped out of it beyond his
reach, sure this wasn’t proper. No gentleman had a right to call a girl
by her Christian name without permission asked and granted; on that
point she was quite clear. Salvatia, indeed. The gentle creature
couldn’t but be affronted and hurt by this.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Oo you gettin’ at, sir?’ she inquired, as in duty bound when faced by
familiarity.</p>

<p>‘You&mdash;you!’ gasped Jocelyn, following her into the corner she had
withdrawn into, and falling at her feet.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Mr. Pinner was of opinion that the sooner they were married the better.
There was that in Mr. Luke’s eye, he told himself, which could only be
got rid of by marriage; nothing but the Church could make the sentiments
the young gentleman appeared to entertain for Sally right ones.</p>

<p>Whipt by fear, he hurried things on as eagerly as Jocelyn himself.
Suppose something happened before there was time to get them married,
and Mr. Luke, as he understood easily occurred with gentlemen in such
circumstances, cooled off? He didn’t leave them a moment alone together
after that first outing in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_21">{21}</a></span> car when Jocelyn asked Sally to marry
him, and she, obedient and wishful of pleasing everybody, besides having
been talked to by her father the night before and told she had his full
consent and blessing, and that it was her duty anyhow, heaven having
sent Mr. Luke on purpose, had remarked amiably that she didn’t mind if
she did.</p>

<p>After this, Mr. Pinner’s one aim was to keep them from being by
themselves till they were safely man and wife. He lived in a fever of
watchfulness. He was obsessed by terror on behalf of Sally’s virginity.
His days were infinitely more wearing than in the worst period of
Islington. Mrs. Pinner was missed and mourned quite desperately. It
almost broke his back, the hurry, the anxiety, the constant gnawing
fear, and the secrecy his future son-in-law insisted on.</p>

<p>‘What you want to be so secret for, Mr. Luke?’ he asked, black
suspicion, always on the alert where Sally was concerned, clouding his
naturally mild and trustful eyes.</p>

<p>‘You don’t want a howling mob of undergraduates round, do you?’ retorted
Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘Goodness gracious, I should think I didn’t, Mr. Luke,’ said Mr. Pinner,
holding up both his little hands in horror. ‘She’s got a reg’lar gift,
that Sally ‘as, for collecting crowds.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Jocelyn irritably, whose nerves were in shreds. And
added, ‘Isn’t it our job to keep them off her?’</p>

<p>‘Your job now, sir&mdash;or will be soon,’ said Mr. Pinner, unable to refrain
from rubbing his hands at the thought of his near release from
responsibility.</p>

<p>‘I wish you wouldn’t keep on calling me sir,’ snapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_22">{22}</a></span> Jocelyn. ‘I’ve
<i>asked</i> you not to. I keep <i>on</i> asking you not to.’</p>

<p>He was nearly in tears with strain and fatigue. Incredibly, he hadn’t
once been able to kiss Sally,&mdash;not properly, not as a lover should.
Always in the presence of that damned Pinner&mdash;such was the way he
thought of his future father-in-law&mdash;what could he do? He couldn’t even
talk to her; not really talk, not pour out the molten streams of
adoration that were scalding him to death while that image of alertness
sat unblinking by. What was the fellow afraid of? He had asked him at
first straight out, on finding how he stuck, to leave them alone, and
the answer he got was that courting should be fair and above board, and
that he was obliged to be both father and mother to the poor girl.</p>

<p>‘Fair and above board! Good God,’ thought Jocelyn, driving himself back
at a furious pace to Cambridge and throwing back his head in a fit of
wild, nervous laughter. His father-in-law&mdash;that little man with trousers
so much too long for him that they corkscrewed round his legs. His
father-in-law....</p>

<p>But what was that in the way of grotesqueness compared to his being her
father? There, indeed, was mystery: that loveliness beyond dreams should
have sprung from Mr. Pinner’s little loins.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The widows of Woodles, and also the virgins, were extremely curious
about Jocelyn’s daily visits, and tried to find out his name, and which
college he belonged to. They were in no doubt as to the object of his
visits, having by that time all seen Sally, and wished to warn Mr.
Pinner to be careful.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>They went to his shop and warned him.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner, looking smaller and more sunk into his trousers than ever,
thanked them profusely, and said he was being it.</p>

<p>‘One has to be on one’s guard with a motherless daughter,’ they said.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner said he was on it.</p>

<p>‘And as your daughter promises to grow up some day into rather a
good-looking girl&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘There ain’t much promise about Sally, mum&mdash;it’s been performance,
performance, <i>and</i> nothing but performance since she was so ’igh.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well&mdash;perhaps it’s not quite as bad as that,’ said the lady
addressed, smiling indulgently. ‘Still, I do think she may grow into a
good-looking girl, and so near Cambridge you will have to be careful.
Your visitor is an undergraduate, of course?’</p>

<p>And Mr. Pinner, afraid of Jocelyn, afraid of his threats of hordes of
young men descending on the shop if the engagement were known, said,
slipping on the edge of an untruth, but just managing to clear it,
‘Couldn’t say, mum.’</p>

<p>She forced him, however&mdash;the woman forced him. ‘What?’ she exclaimed.
‘You can’t say? You don’t know?’</p>

<p>So then he told it without blinking. ‘No, mum,’ he said, his harassed
blue eyes on her face. ‘I don’t think the young gentleman <i>did</i> ’appen
to mention ’is name.’</p>

<p>And in his heart he cried out to his conscience, ‘If they forces me to,
’ow, ’ow can I ’elp it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_24">{24}</a></span>’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Between these two men, both in a state of extreme nervous tension, Sally
passed her last days under her father’s roof, amiably quiescent,
completely good. She did as she was told; always she had done as she was
told, and it was now a habit. She liked the look of the young man who so
unexpectedly was to become her husband, and was pleased that he should
be a gentleman. She knew nothing about gentlemen, but she liked the sort
of sound their voices made when they talked. At Islington she had
preferred the visits to the shop of the clergy for just that reason&mdash;the
sound their voices made when they talked. She would have been perfectly
happy during the fortnight between her first setting eyes on Jocelyn and
her marriage to him, if there had been a few more smiles about.</p>

<p>There were none. Her father was tying her up with trembling haste, as if
she were a parcel to be got rid of in a hurry. Her lover’s face was
haggard, and drawn in the opposite directions to those that lead to
smiles. Dumbly he would gaze at her from under his overhanging brows,
and every now and then burst into a brief explosion of talk she didn’t
understand and hadn’t an idea how to deal with; or he would steal a
shaking hand along the edge of the tablecloth, where her father couldn’t
see it, and touch her dress. He looked just like somebody in a picture,
thought Sally, with his thin dark face, and eyes right far back in his
head,&mdash;quite blue eyes, in spite of his dark skin and hair. She liked
him very much. She liked everybody very much. If only somebody had
sometimes smiled, how nice it all would have been; for then she would
have known for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_25">{25}</a></span> certain they were happy, and were getting what they
wanted. Sally liked to be certain people were happy, and getting what
they wanted. As it was, nobody could tell from their faces that these
two were pleased. Sometimes in the evening, after her lover had gone and
the door was locked and bolted and barred behind him, and all the
windows had been examined and fastened securely, her father would calm
down and cheer up; but her lover never calmed down or cheered up.</p>

<p>Sally, who hardly had what could be called thoughts but only feelings,
was conscious of this without putting it into words. Perhaps when he had
got what he wanted, which was, she was thoroughly aware, herself, he
would be different. There were no doubts whatever in her mind as to what
he wanted. She was too much used to the sort of thing. Not, it is true,
in quite such a violent form, but then none of the others who had
admired her&mdash;that is, every single male she had ever come across&mdash;had
been allowed to be what her father called her fiancy, which was, Sally
understood, the name of the person one was going to marry, and who might
say things and behave in a way no one else might, as distinguished from
the name of the person one went to the pictures with and didn’t marry,
and who was a fancy. She knew that, because, though she herself had only
gone to the pictures wedged between her father and mother, she had heard
the girls at school talk of going with their fancies,&mdash;those girls who
had all been her friends till they began to grow up, and then all, after
saying horrid things to her and crying violently, had got out of her
way.</p>

<p>As though she could help it; as though she could help having the sort of
face that made them angry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">{26}</a></span></p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> ain’t made my silly face,’ she said tearfully&mdash;her delicious mouth
pronounced it fice&mdash;to the last of her girl friends, to the one she was
fondest of, who had hung on longest, but who couldn’t, after all, stand
the look that came into the eyes of him she spoke of as her boy one day
that he chanced to come across Sally.</p>

<p>‘No. No more you didn’t, Sally Pinner,’ furiously retorted the friend.
‘But you would ’ave if you could ’ave, so you’re nothin’ but a
nypocrite&mdash;see?’</p>

<p>And the friend forgot herself still further, and added that Sally was a
blinkin’ nypocrite; which was, as Mr. Pinner would have said had he
heard it, language.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>So that Sally in her short life had already caused trouble and
uneasiness, in spite of having been so carefully kept out of the way.</p>

<p>Wherever there were human beings, those human beings stared at Sally and
began to follow her; or, if they couldn’t follow her with their feet,
did so with astonished, eager eyes as long as she was in sight. Holy
Communion was the only one of the Sunday services Mr. Pinner let her go
to in Woodles, because it was sparsely attended, and the few worshippers
were women. But even at that solemn service the Vicar, who was
seventy-eight, found it difficult altogether to shut out from his
consciousness the lovely figure of grace shining like morning light in
the shadows of his dark little church. He was as instantly aware of
Sally the first Sunday she came to the service as every one else always
was the moment she appeared anywhere, and she had the same effect on the
old man as she had had on the young Jocelyn when first he saw her&mdash;he
caught his breath,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">{27}</a></span> and for a moment was near tears. Because here, the
old man perceived, at the end of his life he was at last beholding
beauty,&mdash;fresh from God, still dewy from its heavenly birth; and the
Vicar, who had long been a recluse, and lived entirely among his
memories, which all were sentimental and poetic, bowed down in spirit
before the young radiance come into his church, as before the Real
Presence.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Such was Sally when young Jocelyn married her&mdash;mild inside, and only
desiring to give satisfaction, and outside a thing that seemed made up
of light. As Mr. Pinner had wished to hide her, so did Jocelyn wish to
hide her, and wanted to be married in London, the least conspicuous of
spots; but technical difficulties prevented this, seeing that he wanted
to be married quickly, so he took the Vicar into his confidence, and got
a special licence, and thus avoiding banns and publicity was married
early one bright March morning, while Woodles, unaware of what was
happening, was still washing up its breakfast things.</p>

<p>By this time Jocelyn was acquainted with Sally’s inability to give a
plain answer to a question, and half expected her to reply ‘I don’t mind
if I do’ to the Vicar when he asked if she would take him, Jocelyn, to
be her wedded husband. She didn’t; but if she had he wouldn’t have
cared, nor would the Vicar have cared. Whatever she did, whatever she
said, was to these two dazzled men the one perfect gesture, the one
perfect word.</p>

<p>But Sally, young and shy, said very little. Hardly had she spoken during
the brief courtship. To the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span> Vicar, full of awe of his office and his
age, she scarcely dared raise her eyes, much less lift up her voice. It
was enough, however; the old man was enthralled. Far from being
surprised at Jocelyn’s determination to take his name off the books of
his college and chuck his promising career and marry Sally and go up to
London to pick up his living as a journalist, a profession for which he
hadn’t the slightest aptitude, the Vicar understood perfectly. The
college authorities, on the other hand, unaware of his reason for
ruining himself, were amazed at such deliberate suicide. They had not
seen Sally. The Vicar, who had, was convinced the young man was doing
the one thing worth doing,&mdash;giving up everything to follow after Truth.</p>

<p>‘For is not Truth Beauty, and Beauty Truth?’ asked the Vicar, too old to
bother any longer with material considerations.</p>

<p>Jocelyn and he were unanimous that it was.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The Vicar, indeed, was an immense comfort to Jocelyn the second and last
week of his engagement, for Mr. Pinner was no comfort at all. Not that
Jocelyn needed comfort at this marvellous moment; but he needed
understanding, some one to talk to, some one who could and would listen
intelligently. Mr. Pinner didn’t listen intelligently; he didn’t listen
at all. All he did was to say heartily, ‘That’s right,’ to everything
Jocelyn said, and such indiscrimination was annoying. It was a deep
refreshment to get away from him and go up to the Vicarage, and there,
slowly pacing up and down with the old man on the sunny path where the
first daffodils were, talk with some one who so completely understood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<p>The Vicar concluded, from the frequency with which his young friend came
to take counsel of him, that he was an orphan, but he asked no questions
because he was long past the age of questions. The age of silence was
his, of quiet resting on his oars, of a last warming of himself in the
light of the sun, before departing hence and being no more seen. By this
time, his mind being faintly bleared, he connected Sally with the <i>Nunc
Dimittis</i>, and thanked God aloud, greatly to her confusion, for she
couldn’t make out what the old gentleman was talking about, for being
allowed to see, before departing in peace, the perfect loveliness of her
whom he called the Lord’s Salvatia. Fitting and right was the young
man’s attitude in the Vicar’s eyes; fitting and right to leave all
things, and follow after this child of grace.</p>

<p>His unpractical attitude was immensely grateful to Jocelyn, who knew,
though during this strange fortnight of thwarted love-making and
arm’s-length worship he managed to forget, that one of the things he was
leaving was his mother.</p>

<p>He hadn’t mentioned it, but he had got one.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Not</span> a father, for he had long been dead, but a mother, whose single joy
and pride he was. There she sat at home by the fire on his wedding
night, thinking of him. No complete half-hour of the day could pass
without the thought of Jocelyn getting into it. Her only child; so
brilliant, so serious, so hard-working, so good. She loved brains. She
loved diligence. She loved the man of the house to be absorbed in his
work. What a halo he was about her head! Everybody round where she lived
knew about him. Everybody had heard of his successes,&mdash;‘My son, who is a
scholar of Ananias.... My son, who is a Prizeman of his University....
My son, who won this year’s Rutherford Prize....’ Great was her reward
for having devoted her life to him and his education, and for having
turned a deaf ear to those suitors who had tried to marry her when she
was a young widow. She wasn’t even now, twenty years later, an old
widow, but she was a widow who was less young.</p>

<p>She lived in one of those suburbs where much is done for the mind. She
was popular in it, and looked up to. She was, in fact, one of its
leading lights,&mdash;cultivated, lady-like, well-read, artistic, interested
in each new movement that came along. And of a most pleasing appearance,
too, being slender at an age when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">{31}</a></span> mothers of the grown-up are
sometimes so no longer, dark haired among the grey, smooth among the
puckered, and her eyes had no crow’s feet, and were calm and beautifully
clear.</p>

<p>She was serenely happy. The <i>milieu</i> suited her exactly. She had come to
South Winch twenty years before from Kensington&mdash;real Kensington, not
West or North, but the part that clusters round the Albert Hall&mdash;on her
husband’s death, because of having to be frugal, but soon discovered it
was the very place for her. Far better, she intelligently recognised, to
be a leading light in a suburb, and know and be known by everybody, than
extinguished and invisible in London. Besides, spring came to the
suburbs in a way it never did to London, and it was the custom in South
Winch, where people were determined to think highly, to think
particularly highly of spring. At the bottom of her half acre there was
only an iron railing separating her from a real meadow belonging to the
big villa of a prosperous City man, and spring, she told the Rector, who
was also a Canon, did things in that meadow it would never dream of
doing near the Albert Hall.</p>

<p>‘Look at those dandelions,’ said Mrs. Luke. ‘I do think the meanest
flower that blows in its natural setting is more beautiful than the
whole of those thought-out effects in Kensington Gardens.’</p>

<p>And the Rector&mdash;the Canon&mdash;said, ‘How true that is,’ and remarked that
she was a Wordsworthian; and Mrs. Luke smiled, and said, ‘Am I?’ and
wasn’t altogether pleased, for Wordsworth, she somehow felt, was no
longer, in the newest opinion, what he was.</p>

<p>While Jocelyn, then, was worshipping Sally across the supper-table of
the private sitting-room he had engaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_32">{32}</a></span> in the hotel at Exeter, where
they were breaking their journey to Cornwall, which was the place he was
going to hide his honeymoon in, and Sally, unable to make head or tail
of his speech and behaviour, was becoming every minute more uneasy, his
mother sat, placid in the security of unconsciousness, by the fire in
Almond Tree Cottage, a house which used, before the era of her careful
simplicity, so foolishly to be called Beulah.</p>

<p>‘A cottage,’ she observed to her sympathetic friends, ‘is the proper
place for me. I’m a poor woman. Five hundred a year’&mdash;why hide
anything?&mdash;‘doesn’t go far these days after Income Tax has been
deducted. Jocelyn has his own five hundred, or we would really have been
in a quite bad way. As it is, I can just manage.’</p>

<p>And she did; and in her clever hands frugality merely seemed comfort
gone a little thin, and nobody liked to ask her for subscriptions.</p>

<p>The house was small and very white, and had a small and very green
garden, with a cedar on the back lawn and an almond tree on the front
one. Two front gates that swang back on their hinges, and a half-moon
carriage-sweep. Railings. Shrubs. The yellow sanded road. Houses
opposite, with almond trees too, or, less prettily, in the front gardens
of the insensitive, monkey puzzles. The hall door was blue. Such
curtains as could be seen at the same time as the door were blue too. At
no season of the year was there not at least one vivid flower stuck in a
slender vessel in the sitting-room window. And in the sitting-room
itself, on the otherwise bare walls, was one picture only,&mdash;a copy,
really very well done, of a gay and charming Tiepolo ceiling&mdash;Mrs. Luke
was the first in South Winch to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_33">{33}</a></span> up Tiepolo&mdash;in which everybody was
delicately happy, in spite of a crucifixion going on in one corner, and
high-spirited, fat little angels tossed roses across the silvery
brightness of what was evidently a perfect summer afternoon. Books, too,
were present; not many, but the right ones. Blake was there; also Donne;
and Sir Thomas Browne; and Proust, in French. A novel, generally
Galsworthy, lay on the little table near the fire, and, by an
arrangement with a circle of friends, most of the better class weeklies
passed through the house in a punctual stream.</p>

<p>Sitting in the deep chair by the fireside table on Jocelyn’s wedding
night, her dark head against the bright cushion that gave the necessary
splash of colour to the restful bareness of the room, her lap full of
reviews she was going to read of the best new books and plays, so as to
be able to discuss them intelligently with him when he came home at
Easter&mdash;only a few more days to wait,&mdash;his mother couldn’t keep her eyes
from wandering off these studies to the glowing little fire of ships’
logs and neat blocks of peat, for her thoughts persisted in flying, like
homing birds, to the nest they always went back to and so warmly rested
in: Jocelyn, and what he was, and what he was going to be.</p>

<p>Other mothers had anxieties; she had never had one. Others had
disappointments; she had had nothing but happy triumphs. He was
retiring, it was true, and stayed up in his little attic-study when he
was at home, and wouldn’t go anywhere except to a Beethoven
concert&mdash;together they had studied all that has been said about
Beethoven, and she had plans for proceeding to the study of all that has
been said about Bach&mdash;or for long tramps with her, when they would eat
bread and cheese<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_34">{34}</a></span> at some wayside inn, and read aloud to each other
between the mouthfuls; but how much richer was she herself for that. And
the comfort of having a <i>good</i> son, a son who cared nothing for even
so-called harmless dissipations! When she looked round at other people’s
sons, and saw the furrows on their fathers’ foreheads&mdash;she smiled at her
own alliterations&mdash;and heard a whisper of the dread word Debts, and knew
where debts came from&mdash;betting, gambling, drinking, women, in a ghastly
crescendo, how could she ever, ever be thankful enough that Jocelyn was
so good? Never once had he betted, gambled, drunk, or&mdash;she smiled again
at her own word&mdash;womaned; she was ready to take her oath he hadn’t.
Didn’t she know him inside out? He kept nothing from her; he couldn’t
have if he had wanted to, bless him, for she, who had watched him from
long before he became conscious, knew him far, far better than he could
possibly know himself.</p>

<p>Many, indeed, were her blessings. Great and conscious her content. Her
dark head on the vivid cushion was full of bright&mdash;why not say
it?&mdash;self-congratulation, which is the other word for thankfulness. And
how not congratulate herself on the possession of that beloved,
brilliant boy? While, to add to everything else, the neighbour, whose
meadow of buttercups she so freely and inexpensively enjoyed from over
the railing on dappled May mornings, was showing unmistakable signs of
wishing to marry her. His year of widowerhood had recently come to an
end, and the very next week he had begun the kind of activity that could
only be described as courting; so that she had this feather, too, to add
to a cap already, she gratefully acknowledged, so full of feathers.
Poor? Yes, she was poor. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_35">{35}</a></span> what was being poor? Nothing at all, if
one refused to mind it.</p>

<p>A third time she smiled, shaking her head at the neat peat blocks as if
they had been the neighbour. ‘Come, come, my friend&mdash;at our ages,’ she
could hear herself saying to him with gentle and flattering raillery&mdash;he
must be at least twenty years older than herself&mdash;when the moment should
arrive. But it was pleasant, this, to sit in her charmingly lit
room&mdash;she was clever at making lampshades&mdash;and to know that next door
was a man, well set up in spite of his sixty odd years, who thought her
desirable, pleasant to be certain she had only to put out her hand, and
take wealth.</p>

<p>And who could say, she mused, but that it mightn’t be the best thing for
Jocelyn too, to have a solid stepfather like that at his back, able to
help him financially? She had spent happy years in the little white
house, and it had rarely worried her that she should be obliged to take
such ceaseless pains to hide the bones of her economies gracefully, but
later on she would be older, and might be tired, and later on Jocelyn
might perhaps want to marry and set up house for himself&mdash;after all, it
would only be natural&mdash;and then she would be lonely, besides being ten
years&mdash;she thought in ten years would be about the time he might wish to
marry&mdash;less attractive than she was now, and getting not only lonelier
with every year but also, she supposed, less attractive; though surely
one oughtn’t to do that, if one’s mind and spirit&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Whereas, if she married the neighbour....<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>He came in at that moment, on the pretext of bringing her back a book
she had lent him, though he hadn’t read it and didn’t mean to, for it
was what he, being a plain man, called high-falutin. He didn’t tell her
this, because when a man is courting he cannot be candid, and he well
knew that he was courting. What he wasn’t sure of was whether she knew.
You never could tell with women; the best of them were artful.</p>

<p>He came in that evening, then, to make it finally clear to her. She was
a charming woman, and much younger, he imagined, than her age, which
couldn’t, he calculated, with a son of twenty-two be far short of
forty-two, and he had always greatly admired the pluck with which she
faced what seemed to him sheer destitution. She was the very woman, too,
to have at the head of one’s table when one had friends to
dinner,&mdash;good-looking, knowing how to dress, able to talk about any
mortal thing, and a perfect lady. And after the friends had gone, and it
was time to go to bye-bye&mdash;such were the words his thoughts clothed
themselves in,&mdash;she would still be a desirable companion, even if&mdash;again
his words&mdash;a bit on the thin side. That, however, would soon be set
right when he had fed her up on all the good food she hadn’t ever been
able to afford, and anyhow she was years and years younger than poor
Annie, who had been the same age as himself, which was all right to
begin with, but no sort of a show in the long run. Also, Annie had
stayed common.</p>

<p>So the neighbour, whose name was Mr. Thorpe, arrived on Jocelyn’s
wedding night about nine o’clock in the restrained sitting-room of
Almond Tree Cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_37">{37}</a></span> determined to make his purpose clear. That he
should be refused didn’t enter his head, for he had much to offer. He
was far the richest man in the parish, his two daughters were married
and out of the way, his house and cars were bigger than anybody’s, and
he grew pineapples. He couldn’t help thinking, he couldn’t help knowing,
that for a woman of over forty he was a catch, and he went into the
room, past the reverent-eyed small maid who held the door open,
expanding his chest. A poverty-stricken little room, he always
considered, with nothing in it of the least account, except the lady.</p>

<p>Yes; except the lady. But what a lady. Not a grey hair in her head,
which he had carefully examined when she wasn’t looking, nor, he would
wager, any tooth that wasn’t exclusively her own. And a trim ankle; and
a pretty wrist. Ruffles, too. He liked ruffles at a woman’s wrist. And
able to talk about any mortal thing. Annie, poor creature, had made him
look like a fool when he had his friends to dinner. This one would be
the finest of the feathers in a cap which, he too gratefully
acknowledged, was stuck full of them.</p>

<p>‘All alone, eh?’ he said cheerily. ‘That’s bad.’</p>

<p>‘I’m used to it,’ said Mrs. Luke, smilingly holding out her slender
hand, on which a single ruby&mdash;or was it a garnet? probably a
garnet&mdash;caught the light. She had on a wine-coloured, soft woollen dress
that Jocelyn liked, and the ring and the dress went very well together.</p>

<p>A pretty picture; a perfect lady. Mr. Thorpe, determined to waste no
time in making his purpose clear, bent his head and kissed the hand.</p>

<p>‘Being used to a bad thing doesn’t make it better, but worse,’ he said,
drawing up the only other really<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">{38}</a></span> comfortable chair&mdash;Jocelyn’s&mdash;and
sitting down close to her.</p>

<p>And he was about to embark then and there on his proposal, for he hated
waste of anything, including time, and Mrs. Luke was already drawing up
her shoulders to her ears in an instinctive movement of defence, for she
would have liked to have had longer to turn the thing over in her mind,
and discover really whether his splendid illiteracy&mdash;it was so immense
as to appear magnificent&mdash;would be a source of pleasure to her or
suffering, whether the pleasure of filling up his mind’s emptiness would
be greater than the pains of such an exertion, whether, in short, she
hadn’t better refuse him, when the little maid came in with the silver
salver she had been trained to present letters on, and held it out
before her mistress.</p>

<p>‘Letters, eh?’ said Mr. Thorpe, nettled by this interruption. ‘I should
give orders they’re to be left in the&mdash;well, you can’t call it a hall,
can you, so let’s say passage.’</p>

<p>The little maid, alarmed, sidled out of the room.</p>

<p>‘I would indeed, if it weren’t that I can’t bear to wait a minute when
it’s a letter from Jocelyn,’ said Mrs. Luke, holding the letter tight,
for she saw it was from him. ‘You wouldn’t be able to wait either, would
you,’ she went on, smiling more brightly even than usual, for the mere
touch of the letter made her more bright, ‘for anything you loved.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Mr. Thorpe sturdily, seizing this opening. ‘No. I wouldn’t.
And that’s why I’ve come round&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But she didn’t hear. ‘You’ll forgive me, won’t you my dear friend,’ she
murmured, slitting the envelope<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">{39}</a></span> with an enamelled paper-knife lest she
should harm the dear contents, ‘but I haven’t heard from that boy for
over a fortnight, and I’ve been beginning to wonder&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh, certainly, certainly. Don’t mind me,’ said Mr. Thorpe, aggrieved.
‘Mark my words, though,’ he added, sitting up very square and broad in
his chair, and giving the knees of his trousers a twitch each, ‘one
shouldn’t overdo the son business.’</p>

<p>She didn’t hear. Her eyes were running down the lines of the letter,
while she muttered something about just wanting to see if he were well.</p>

<p>‘Damned stuck up young prig,’ Mr. Thorpe was in the act of saying to
himself, resentfully watching this absorption, when he was interrupted
by a complete and alarming change in the lady.</p>

<p>She gave a violent shudder; she dropped the letter on the floor, as
though her shaking hands couldn’t hold it; and then, fixing her large
grey eyes on his, opened her mouth and moaned.</p>

<p>He stared at her. He couldn’t think what was the matter.</p>

<p>‘Sick, eh?’ he asked, staring.</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>oh</i>&mdash;&mdash;’ was all she said, turning her face from him, and burying
it in the cushion.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Well, what does one do with a woman who buries her face in a cushion?
Comforts her, of course, thought Mr. Thorpe, again seizing his
opportunity. The young ass couldn’t be dead, or he wouldn’t have
written. But he might&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe paused at the thought, and withdrew the hand already put out
to pat. Yes; that was it. Better<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_40">{40}</a></span> not comfort just yet. For the young
fool had no doubt run into debt, and was being threatened with
proceedings, and was trying to persuade his mother to pay, and Mr.
Thorpe didn’t want to begin his betrothal with having to shell out for
somebody else’s scapegrace son.</p>

<p>His hand, accordingly, slowly redescended on to his knee, where it
rested motionless while he stared at the figure in the chair. Pretty
figure. Nice lines. Graceful, even in her upset. She only needed very
little, just the weeniest bit, fattening up. But she shouldn’t have
spoiled that son. Women were fools about their sons.</p>

<p>Then, noticing that the letter was lying at his feet, and the lady, her
face in the cushion, was incapable of observing what he did, he put on
his eyeglasses, picked it up carefully so that it shouldn’t rustle, and,
remarking to himself that all was fair in love and war, read it.</p>

<p>Having read it, he as carefully replaced it on the carpet, took off his
eyeglasses, and began to comfort.</p>

<p>For it wasn’t debts, it was marriage; the best thing possible from Mr.
Thorpe’s point of view&mdash;clearing the field, leaving the mother free to
turn her thoughts to other ties. And a good job too, for the young ass
had gone clean off his head. What a letter. He ought to be ashamed of
himself, writing sick stuff like that to his mother. Married this very
day. Given up Cambridge. Chucked his career. Finished with ambitions.
Going to earn his own living in London. Mother bound to love&mdash;no, it was
put hotter than that&mdash;worship the girl, who was more beautiful than any
angel&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Tut, tut. Silly young ass, caught by the first handsome slut.</p>

<p>‘Better tell me about it,’ said Mr. Thorpe, leaning forward and laying
his hand with unhesitating kindness<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_41">{41}</a></span> on Mrs. Luke’s shoulder. ‘Nothing
like getting things off one’s chest. Count on me. Whatever your son’s
done I’ll help. I’ll do anything&mdash;anything at all, mind you, to help.’</p>

<p>And Jocelyn’s mother, completely overwhelmed by the incredible sudden
smash up of everything she had lived for, did, on hearing this kind,
steady male voice through her misery, turn to Mr. Thorpe as the drowning
turn to any spar, and, making odd little noises, stooped down and tried
to pick up the letter.</p>

<p>But her hands shook too much. He had to pick it up for her.</p>

<p>‘Read it&mdash;&mdash;,’ she said in a sobbing whisper.</p>

<p>So he took out his eyeglasses, and read it again.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>‘Now what you’ve got to do,’ said Mr. Thorpe, folding it up neatly when
he had finished, and laying it down on the little table, ‘is to make up
your mind that what’s done can’t be undone.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke, her head buried in the cushions, moaned.</p>

<p>‘That’s it,’ said Mr. Thorpe, a hand on each knee and an eye on her.
‘That’s the ticket.’</p>

<p>‘I know&mdash;I know,’ moaned Mrs. Luke. ‘But just at first&mdash;the shock&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Shock, eh? I don’t know that there’s much shock about marriage,’ said
Mr. Thorpe. ‘Shouldn’t be, anyhow.’</p>

<p>‘But so sudden&mdash;so unexpected&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘People will marry, you know,’ said Mr. Thorpe. ‘Especially men. Once
they get set on it, nothing stops ’em.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_42">{42}</a></span></p>
<p>‘I know&mdash;I know&mdash;but Jocelyn&mdash;such a boy&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Boy, eh? Age has precious little to do with it,’ said Mr. Thorpe
firmly. ‘In fact, nothing.’</p>

<p>‘But his prospects&mdash;his career&mdash;all thrown away&mdash;ruined&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Marriage never harmed a man yet,’ said Mr. Thorpe still more firmly,
aware that he was being inaccurate, but also aware that no one can
afford to be accurate and court simultaneously. Accuracy, Mr. Thorpe
knew, comes after marriage, not before.</p>

<p>‘Mark my words,’ he went on, ‘that clever son of yours won’t stop being
clever because he’s married. Who’s going to take his brains from him?
Not a loving wife, you bet. Why, a good wife, a loving wife, doubles and
trebles a man’s output.’</p>

<p>‘How kind you are,’ murmured Mrs. Luke, who did find this comforting.
‘But Jocelyn&mdash;my boy&mdash;to keep it from me&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Bound to keep something from his mother,’ said Mr. Thorpe. ‘Mothers are
all right, and a man has to have them to start with, but the day comes
when a back seat is what they’ve got to climb into. Only as regards
their children, mind you,’ he added. ‘A woman has many other strings to
her bow, and is by no means nothing but a mother.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but we were everything, everything to each other,’ moaned Mrs.
Luke, stabbed afresh by the mention of a back seat. ‘Always, always. He
never <i>looked</i> at another woman&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Damned prig,’ thought Mr. Thorpe. And said out aloud, ‘Time he began,
then. Though having a woman like you about,’ he added, placing his hand
with determination on hers, which hung limply down holding a
handkerchief while her face was still turned away, ‘ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_43">{43}</a></span> to keep him
from seeing the others all right. You’re a wonderful woman, you know&mdash;a
remarkable woman.’</p>

<p>His voice changed. It took on the unmistakable note that is immediately
followed by love-making.</p>

<p>‘I&mdash;think I’ll go and lie down,’ said Mrs. Luke faintly, recognising the
note, and feeling she could bear no more of anything that night. ‘I&mdash;I
really think I must. My head&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>She struggled to get up.</p>

<p>He helped her. He helped her by laying hold of both her wrists, and
drawing her upwards and towards him.</p>

<p>‘Head, eh?’ he said, a gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘How kind, how kind&mdash;&mdash;’ she murmured distractedly, finding herself on
her feet and very close to Mr. Thorpe, who still held her wrists.</p>

<p>She wanted her letter. She looked about helplessly for her letter,
keeping her head as far away from him as she could. There was her
letter&mdash;on the table&mdash;she wanted to snatch it up&mdash;to get away as quickly
as possible&mdash;to hide in her bedroom&mdash;and her wrists were being held, and
she couldn’t move.</p>

<p>‘Kind, eh? Kind, you call it?’ said Mr. Thorpe through his teeth. ‘I can
be kinder than that.’ And he put his arms round her, and drew her
vigorously to his chest.</p>

<p>‘This in exchange for Jocelyn,’ drifted through Mrs. Luke’s wretched and
resisting mind.</p>

<p>But, even through her wretchedness and resistance she felt there was
something rock-like, something solid and fixed, about Mr. Thorpe’s
chest, to which in the present catastrophe, with the swirling waters of
bitterest disappointment raging round her feet, it might be well to
cling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_44">{44}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">And</span> while these things were happening in Almond Tree Cottage, Jocelyn,
in the private sitting-room of the Exeter hotel, was behaving, it seemed
to Sally, in the most strange way.</p>

<p>If this was what married gentlemen were like, then she wondered that
there should be any married ladies left. Enough to kill them off like
flies, thought Sally, helplessly involved in frequent and alarming
embraces. Still, she held on hard in her mind to what her father had
said to her the evening before, when she was going up to bed,&mdash;‘Sally,’
her father had said, calling her back a moment and looking solemn,
‘don’t you take no notice of what Mr. Luke do or don’t, once ’e’s your
’usband. ’Usbands ain’t gentlemen, remember&mdash;not ordinary, day-time
gentlemen, such as you thinks they are till you knows better. And you
just say to yourself as ’ow your mother went through it all before you
was so much as born, and she was a bit of all right, warn’t she? So you
just remember that, my girl, if by any chance you should ’appen to get
the fidgets.’</p>

<p>She did remember it, though it was Mr. Luke&mdash;so she thought of him&mdash;who
had the fidgets. He didn’t seem able to sit quiet for two minutes in his
chair, and eat his supper, and let her eat hers. Such a lovely<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_45">{45}</a></span> supper,
too&mdash;a real shame to let it get cold. What was the good of ordering a
lovely supper if one wasn’t going to eat it properly?</p>

<p>More and more earnestly as the evening progressed did she wish herself
back in the peaceful parlour behind the shop; less and less did the
thought of her mother having been through all this too support her,
because she became surer every minute that she hadn’t been through it.
Never in his life could her father have behaved as Mr. Luke was
behaving. Entirely unused to kisses, except evenings and mornings, and
then just one on her cheek and over and done with at once, Sally
couldn’t get over the number and length of Mr. Luke’s. Also, it
surprised her very much to see a gentleman interrupt his supper&mdash;and
such a lovely supper&mdash;to run round the table and go down on his knees
and kiss her shoes,&mdash;new ones, of course, but still not things that
ought to be kissed; it surprised her so much, that she came over quite
queer each time.</p>

<p>She thought it a great mercy he had locked the door, so that the grand
waiter couldn’t get in, for the grand waiter, staring at her while he
handed her the dishes and calling her Madam, alarmed her in his way very
nearly as much as Mr. Luke alarmed her in his; yet, on the other hand,
if the waiter was locked out she was locked in, so that it cut both
ways, thought Sally, wishing she might be let eat the meringue the
waiter had left on her plate before being locked out. But every time she
tried to, Mr. Luke seemed to have to be kissed.</p>

<p>And the way Mr. Luke, when he did stay still a minute in his chair,
never took his eyes off her, and the things he said! And he didn’t seem
a bit happy either, in spite of talking such a lot about heaven and the
angels.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_46">{46}</a></span> If only he had seemed happy Sally wouldn’t have minded so much,
for then at least somebody would have been getting some good out of it;
but he looked all upset, and as if he were going to be ill,&mdash;sickening
for something, she concluded.</p>

<p>For a long time she kept up her manners, bravely clinging to them and
trying hard to guess when was the right moment to say Yes and when to
say No, which was very difficult because he talked so queerly, and she
hadn’t an idea what most of it meant; for a long time she was able to
smile politely, if anxiously, every time she looked up and caught his
fierce and burning eye; but all of a sudden, perpetually thwarted in her
efforts to eat the meringue, and very hot and uncomfortable from so much
kissing, she found she couldn’t do anything any more that was proper,
wasn’t able to smile, said No when it ought to have been Yes, lost her
nerve, and to her own surprise and excessive shame began to whimper.</p>

<p>Very quietly she whimpered, very beautifully, her head drooping
exquisitely on its adorable little neck, while the meringue she had so
badly wanted to be allowed to eat for the last quarter of an hour was
finally renounced, and left to waste and dribble away its expensive
cream on her plate.</p>

<p>Jocelyn was appalled.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sally&mdash;oh, my angel&mdash;oh, my heavenly, heavenly child!’ he cried,
flinging himself once again at her feet, while she once again quickly
drew them up beneath her frock, as she had done each time before.</p>

<p>She apologised humbly. She was really terribly ashamed,&mdash;and he so good
to her, spending all that money on such a splendid supper.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_47">{47}</a></span></p>

<p>‘I ain’t cried but once before in my life,’ she explained, fumbling for
her handkerchief, while the tears welled up in her enchanting sweet
eyes. ‘When mother died, that was, but I never didn’t not else. Dunno
what come over me, Mr. Luke&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Only once before! When your mother died! And now on your wedding day!
Oh, Sally&mdash;it’s me&mdash;I’ve made you&mdash;I, who would die a thousand deaths to
spare a single perfect hair of your divine little head&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Don’t say that, Mr. Luke&mdash;please now, don’t say that,’ Sally earnestly
begged, much perturbed by this perpetual harping on death and angels.
And having at last got out her handkerchief, she was just going to wipe
her eyes decently when he snatched it from her and didn’t let her do
anything, but actually kissed away the tears as they rolled out.</p>

<p>‘You ain’t ’alf fond of kissin’, are you, Mr. Luke,’ murmured Sally
miserably, helplessly obliged to hand over her tears to what seemed to
her a really horrid fate, while to herself she was saying in resigned,
unhappy astonishment, ‘And them my very own eyes, too, when all’s said
and done.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>It was three days later that Jocelyn, for the first time, said, ‘Don’t
say that, Sally,’ in a tone of command.</p>

<p>He had told her many times not to call him Mr. Luke, told her
entreatingly, caressingly, playfully, that he was her husband Jocelyn,
and no longer ever any more to be Mr. anything on her darling lips; and
when she forgot, for habits in Sally died hard, smilingly and adoringly
reminded her.</p>

<p>But this time, after three whole days’ honeymoon and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_48">{48}</a></span> three whole
nights, he commanded; adding in a tone of real annoyance, ‘And for God’s
sake don’t look at people when they pass.’</p>

<p>‘I ain’t lookin’ at them,’ protested Sally, flushing, who never wanted
to look at anybody, besides having been taught by the anxious Pinners
that no modest girl did. ‘They looks at me.’</p>

<p>It was true. Jocelyn knew it was true, but nevertheless was angry, and
caught hold of her arm and marched her up a side lane from the sea, up
to the less inhabited hill at the back of the village.</p>

<p>For they were at St. Mawes, the little cut-off fishing village in South
Cornwall which had lived in Jocelyn’s memory ever since, two years
before, on an Easter bicycling tour with his mother, he and she had
suddenly dropped down on it from the hill above, unaware of its
existence till they were right on it, so completely was it tucked away
and hidden. It had lived in his memory as the most difficult spot to get
at, and therefore probably the most solitary, of any he had come across.
Miles from a railway, miles from the nearest town, only to be reached,
unless one went to it by sea, along a most difficult and tortuous road
that ended by throwing one down a precipice on to a ferry-boat which
took one across the Fal and shot one out at the foot of another
precipice,&mdash;or so the two hills seemed to Jocelyn and his mother, who
had to push their bicycles up them&mdash;he considered it the place of places
to hide his honeymoon in; to hide, that is, the precious and conspicuous
Sally.</p>

<p>His recollection of it was just a village street along the sea, an inn
or two, a shop or two, a fisherman or two, and in the middle of the day
complete emptiness.</p>

<p>The very place.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">{49}</a></span></p>

<p>He wrote, trembling with excitement, to its post office to get him
rooms, rooms for his wife and himself&mdash;his wife; oh, my God! thought
Jocelyn, still a week off his wedding day.</p>

<p>The post office got him rooms,&mdash;a tiny bedroom, almost filled by the
bed, a tiny parlour, almost filled by the table, and a fisherman and his
wife, who lived in the rest of the cottage, to look after them.</p>

<p>The first day they were out in a boat all day being shown coves by the
fisherman, who stared hard at Sally, and whenever they wanted to go back
took them to see another cove instead; but the second day, the
imperativeness of daily exercise having been part of Jocelyn’s early
training, he felt it his duty to exercise Sally, and emerged with her
during the quiet hour after their mid-day meal for a blow along the sea
front.</p>

<p>She had already said, when he asked her if she would like to go out,
that she didn’t mind if she did, and he had passed it over because he
happened to be looking at her when she said it, and no one who happened
to be looking at Sally when she said anything was able to pay much
attention to her words. Jocelyn couldn’t, anyhow, only three days
married; but out on the sea front, walking side by side, his eyes fixed
ahead in growing surprise at the number of people suddenly come out,
like themselves, apparently, for blows, when in answer to his remark
that the place seemed more populous than he had imagined, she said, ‘It
do, don’t it, Mr. Luke,’ he snapped at her.</p>

<p>Snapped at her. Snapped at his angel, his child of light, his being from
another sphere, who ought, he had told her, making her fidget a good
deal, for whatever did he mean? sit for ever on a sapphire throne, and
be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_50">{50}</a></span> crowned by stars, and addressed only in the language of Beethoven’s
symphonies. But then there were these confounded people suddenly sprung
from nowhere, and it was enough to make any man snap, the way they
looked at Sally. Where did they come from? Where were they going? What
did they want?</p>

<p>Jocelyn seized her, and hurried her up the side path that led over the
hill to the quiet country at the back. He was excessively put out. The
swine&mdash;the idle, ogling swine, he thought, rushing her up the steep path
at such a rate that the willing Sally, obediently putting her best leg
foremost, nevertheless, light and active as she was, arrived at the top
so breathless that she couldn’t speak.</p>

<p>Not that she wanted to speak. Never much of a hand at what her girl
friends, when she still had them, used to call back-chat, the brief
period of her honeymoon had taught her how safe and snug silence was
compared to the draughty dangers of speech. Marriage, she already felt,
groping dimly about in it, wasn’t at all like anything one was used to.
It seemed swampy underfoot. You started walking along it, and it looked
all right, when in you went. Husbands&mdash;difficult to know where one was
with <i>them</i>, thought Sally. They changed about so. One moment on their
knees as if one was a church, and the next rushing one off one’s feet up
a hill such as one couldn’t have believed possible if one hadn’t seen it
for oneself, and their face all angry. Angry? What for? wondered Sally,
who was never angry.</p>

<p>‘It’s that hair of yours,’ said Jocelyn, got to the top, and standing
still a moment, for he too was panting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him uncomprehendingly, in a lovely surprise. He was
frowning at the sea, and the bit of road along it visible at their feet,
on which still crawled a few black specks.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ow?’ Sally was injudicious enough to ask; but after all it was only
one word&mdash;she was careful to say only one word.</p>

<p>One was enough, though.</p>

<p>‘How, Sally&mdash;<i>how</i>, <small>HOW</small>. You really <i>must</i> learn to say <i>how</i>,’ said
Jocelyn, exasperated.</p>

<p>‘I did say ’ow,’ explained Sally meekly.</p>

<p>‘Yes. You did. Exactly,’ said Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘Ain’t it right to say ’ow?’ she asked, anxious for instruction.</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you <i>any</i> ear?’ was Jocelyn’s answer, turning to her with a
kind of pounce.</p>

<p>Sally was still more surprised. What a question. Of course she had an
ear. Two of them. And she was going to tell him so when his face, as he
looked at her, changed to the one he had when he got talking about
heaven and angels.</p>

<p>For how could Jocelyn stay irritated with anything like that? He had
only to turn and look at her for all his silly anger to shrivel up. In
the presence of her loveliness, what a mere mincing worm he was, with
his precise ways of speech, and his twopenny-halfpenny little bit of
superior education. As though it mattered, as though it mattered,
thought Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sally, I didn’t mean it,’ he said, catching up her hand and kissing
it, which made her feel very awkward and ashamed, somehow, having a
thing like that done to her hand, and in broad daylight, too, and out of
doors. ‘But you should try and tuck your hair more out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_52">{52}</a></span> sight&mdash;look,
this way,’ he went on, gently taking her hat off and arranging her hair
for her before putting it on again. ‘You see,’ he explained, ‘it does
catch the eye so, doesn’t it, my beautiful, flaming seraphim&mdash;oh, my
God,’ he added under his breath, ‘how beautiful you are!’</p>

<p>‘It don’t make no difference,’ said Sally in a resigned voice.</p>

<p>‘What doesn’t?’</p>

<p>‘If you tucks it in or don’t. They always looks at me. We tried
everything at ’ome, Father and Mother did, but they always looks at me.’</p>

<p>She spoke with deprecation and apology. Best let him know the worst at
once, for she was thoroughly aware of her disabilities and the endless
trouble she had given her parents; while as for their scoldings, and
exhortations, and dark hints of bad things that might happen to her,
hadn’t they rung in her ears since she was twelve? But what could she
do? There she was. Having been born like that, how could she help it?</p>

<p>And another thing she couldn’t help, though she was unconscious that she
did it, was that every time she caught the amiable eye of a stranger,
and she had never yet met any stranger who hadn’t amiable eyes, she
smiled. Just a little; just an involuntary gratitude for the
friendliness in the eye that had been caught. And as she had two
dimples, otherwise invisible, the smile, which would anyhow have been
lovely on that face, was of exceeding loveliness, and complications
followed, and angry chidings from the worn-out Pinners, and, in Sally, a
resigned surprise.</p>

<p>It was while she was trying to convey to Jocelyn that whatever he did
with her hair she was doomed to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span> looked at, and was at the same time
shaking it back so as to help him to get it neat&mdash;it looked startlingly
vivid against the grey background of sea and sky&mdash;that a young man
called Carruthers, out for a run with his dog after a stuffy Sunday
family lunch, came round the bend of the path, whistling and swinging
his stick, and stopped dead when he saw her.</p>

<p>His dog rushed on, however, and ran up to the spirit-thing, and sniffed
and wagged round it, and seemed quite pleased; so it was real, it wasn’t
a spirit, it wasn’t the beginning in his own brain of hallucinations on
burning, Blake-like lines.</p>

<p>He stood gazing. He had never seen anything like that before,&mdash;no, by
Jove, nor had most other people. ‘Oh, I say&mdash;don’t, don’t, <i>don’t</i> put
it on yet!’ he nearly cried out as he saw the hat in the dark,
Iberian-looking youth’s hands being raised quickly above the girl’s head
when that confounded dog disturbed them, and knew that in another
instant it would descend and the light go out.</p>

<p>The Iberian’s movements, however, were swift and decided, and the hat
was not only put on but pulled on,&mdash;tugged on with vigour as far down
over her eyes as it would go; and then, after a frowning glance round,
the fellow drew her hand through his arm and walked her off quickly in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for Carruthers but to call his dog&mdash;an attractive
bitch, who would have been a Sealyham if it hadn’t been for something
its mother did once,&mdash;and it wasn’t Carruthers’ fault that it too should
chance to be called Sally.</p>

<p>‘Sally! Sally!’ he therefore very naturally shouted, raising his voice
as much as possible, which was a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">{54}</a></span> deal. ‘Sally! Come here! Sally!
Come <i>here</i>, I tell you!’</p>

<p>The hills round St. Mawes reverberated with entreaties that Sally should
come.</p>

<p>She did come, his Sally did, but behind it, running, came the Iberian as
well. The girl was out of sight round the corner. Young Carruthers
watched the hurrying approach of her companion with surprise, which
increased when he saw the expression on his face.</p>

<p>‘How dare you! How dare you!’ shouted Jocelyn directly he was near
enough; upon which Carruthers’ surprise became amazement.</p>

<p>‘What’s up?’ he inquired.</p>

<p>‘How dare you call out Sally, and tell her to come here? Eh? What do you
mean by it? You&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I say&mdash;hold on,’ exclaimed Carruthers quickly, raising a defensive arm.
‘Hold on a bit. Look&mdash;here she is, here’s Sally&mdash;&mdash;’ and he pointed to
the fawning sinner.</p>

<p>Jocelyn’s fists fell limply to his sides. He flushed, and looked
extremely foolish. ‘I’m sorry,’ he muttered.</p>

<p>‘Don’t mention it,’ said Carruthers, with immense sarcastic politeness.</p>

<p>‘It&mdash;it’s my wife’s name,’ stammered Jocelyn, ‘and I thought you knew
her, and were incredibly cheeking her&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Carruthers, staring at his nervous twitching face, didn’t laugh, but
simply nodded. Having seen Sally he simply nodded.</p>

<p>‘That’s all right,’ he said gravely; and for some reason added
impulsively, ‘old man.’</p>

<p>He watched the thin figure hurrying off again. ‘A bit of
responsibility,’ he thought. ‘The poor chap looks<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_55">{55}</a></span> all nerves and funk
already&mdash;&mdash;’ for it was plain they couldn’t have been married long,
plain they were both too young to have been anything long.</p>

<p>Carruthers, who was as solid and matter-of-fact outside as he wasn’t
inside, turned away so as not again to interrupt, and went home across
the fields whistling sad tunes in minor keys. Marvellous beyond
imagining to be married to beauty like that, but&mdash;yes, by God, one would
be on wires the whole time, there’d be no end to one’s anxieties. And
his final conclusion was that Jocelyn was a poor devil.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>He might have concluded it even more emphatically if he could have
followed him, and seen what he saw when he got round the corner where
Sally had been left for a moment&mdash;only for a moment, mind you, said
Jocelyn to himself indignantly,&mdash;and found her the centre of an absorbed
group.</p>

<p>She was smiling at two men and a woman, who were smiling and talking to
her with every appearance of profound and eager interest. She was, in
fact, being polite; a habit against which Mr. Pinner had repeatedly
warned her, but, for the reason that it wasn’t a habit at all but her
natural inability not to return smiles for smiles, had warned her in
vain.</p>

<p>These people, climbing up the hill on its other side and finding her
standing there alone, had asked her, their faces wreathed in smiles and
their eyes wide with astonishment and delight, the way; and she had only
politely told them she was a stranger in those parts, and they were only
asking her a few kindly questions, to which she had only answered, ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ere
on my ’oneymoon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_56">{56}</a></span>’ and they were only expressing hopes that she would
have a good time, when Jocelyn descended, swift, lean and vengeful, on
the otherwise harmonious group.</p>

<p>‘Yes?’ said Jocelyn, scowling round at them. ‘Yes?’</p>

<p>‘My ’usband,’ introduced Sally, with a gesture of all-including
friendliness.</p>

<p>But it was no use her being friendly. Jocelyn was rude. How not be rude,
with those two men standing there staring as if their eyes would bulge
right out?</p>

<p>‘I was under the impression,’ he said, glaring at them up and down, from
the top of their badly hatted heads, along their under-exercised and
over-coated bodies to their unsatisfactory feet, ‘that it was possible
in England to leave a lady alone for two minutes without her being
subject to annoyance.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure&mdash;&mdash;’ began the woman of the party, turning very red, while
the men looked both scared and sheepish.</p>

<p>‘Don’t mind ‘<i>im</i>,’ said Sally sweetly, desirous of mollifying.</p>

<p>‘On the contrary, I assure you that you had much better&mdash;much better,’
declared Jocelyn truculently. And again he pulled Sally’s hand through
his arm, and again he hurried her off.</p>

<p>‘Really,’ he said, when they were out of sight, and only green fields,
empty of everything but cows, were visible. ‘Really.’</p>

<p>He stopped and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ot?’ ventured Sally, timid but sympathetic.</p>

<p>‘To think that I can’t leave you alone a minute!’ he cried.</p>

<p>‘They ask me the way,’ Sally explained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_57">{57}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Quite,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Quite. And what did you say, might I inquire?’</p>

<p>‘Said as ’ow I didn’t know it.’</p>

<p>‘Quite,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Quite.’</p>

<p>‘Bein’, as one might say, a stranger in these parts,’ Sally explained
still further, for these repeated quites upset her into speech.</p>

<p>‘Quite,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Quite.’</p>

<p>‘Now don’t say that, Mr. Luke&mdash;please don’t, now,’ she begged.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you, on your part, won’t say Mr. Luke,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Not
quite so often. Not more than a dozen times a day, for instance.’</p>

<p>Sally was silent. She mustn’t think of him as Mr. Luke, she couldn’t
think of him by his outlandish other name, so she thought of him as
Husband. ’Usband’s cross,’ she thought; and withdrew into a prudent
dumbness.</p>

<p>He ended by scrambling her through the hedge, and across a field as far
from the path as possible; and, sitting her down with her back to
everything except another hedge, tried to tell her a few things of a
necessary but minatory nature.</p>

<p>‘Sally,’ he began, lying down on the grass beside her and taking her
hand in his, ‘you know, don’t you, that I love you?’</p>

<p>Sally, cautiously coming out of her silence for a moment, as one who
puts a toe into cold water and instantly draws it back again, said,
‘Yes, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;’ stopping herself just in time, and hastily amending,
‘What I means is, yes.’</p>

<p>‘And you know, don’t you, that my one thought is for you and your
happiness?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_58">{58}</a></span>’</p>

<p>Yes, she supposed she knew that, thought Sally, fidgeting uneasily, for
though the voice and manner were the voice and manner of Mr. Luke there
was somehow a smack about them that reminded her of her father when he
was going to do what was known in the family as learning her.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you?’ insisted Jocelyn, as she said nothing. ‘Don’t you?’</p>

<p>He looked up into her face in search of an answer, and his voice
faltered, he forgot completely what he was going to say, and whispering
‘Oh, I <i>worship</i> you!’ began kissing the hand he held, covering it with
kisses, and seizing the other one and covering it with kisses too, while
his ears, she could see, for his head lay in her lap, went crimson.</p>

<p>And Sally, who had already discovered that when Jocelyn’s ears turned
crimson he did nothing but kiss her and murmur words that were not,
however incomprehensible, anyhow angry ones, knew that for this time she
was being let off.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">{59}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">He</span> kept her indoors for the rest of the day, and decided that in future
they would use the car as a means of getting well out of reach of St.
Mawes, and then, leaving it in some obscure village, take the necessary
exercise undisturbed. The boat would have done for getting away in, but
the fisherman wouldn’t let them have it without him, and he too stared
persistently at Sally. His ridiculous name was Cupp. ‘Serve him right,’
thought Jocelyn, who disliked him intensely.</p>

<p>These difficulties considerably interfered with the peace of the
honeymoon. Having to take precautions, and scheme before doing ordinary
things such as go out for a walk, seemed perfectly monstrous to Jocelyn.
He was inclined, though he struggled against it, to blame Sally. He knew
it was grossly unfair to blame her, but then it was outside his theories
that a modest woman, however lovely, shouldn’t be able in England to
proceed on her lawful occasions unmolested. There must be, he thought,
something in Sally’s behaviour, though he couldn’t quite see what.</p>

<p>He took her away the next morning for the whole day in the car, and,
leaving it at a lonely wayside inn, marched her off for the exercise
they both needed. He needed it, he knew, for he was getting quite
livery, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_60">{60}</a></span> so, he dared say, was she; though it would have been as
easy to imagine a new-born flower having a liver as Sally. Anyhow, she
must be exercised; her health was now his concern, Jocelyn told himself.
Everything of hers was now his concern. The lovely child had been
miraculously handed over to him by Destiny&mdash;thus augustly did he dub Mr.
Pinner&mdash;and there was no one but him to protect and guide and teach her.
No one but him jolly well should, either, said Jocelyn to himself,
baring his teeth at the mere thought, savagely possessive, strongly
resembling a growling dog over a newly-acquired bone.</p>

<p>But it was trying, having to hide her like this. It came to that, that
he had to hide her if he was to have any peace. Well, when he took her
to London, and settled down there seriously, there wouldn’t be this
trouble, because he intended to live in the slums. Slums were the
places, he felt sure, for being let alone in. Not, of course, the more
cut-throat kind, but obscure streets where everybody was too busy being
poor to be interested in a girl’s beauty. To be interested in that,
Jocelyn thought he knew, you have to have had and be going to have a
properly filling dinner every day. No dinners, no love. One only had to
think a little to see this must be so. In such a street, how peaceful
they would be, he in one room writing, she in another room not writing.
Nor would there be any servant difficulty for them either, because Sally
was used to housework, and knew no other conditions than those in which
she had to do it herself. He and she were going to lead simple lives,
irradiated by her enchanting loveliness; and presently, when she had
begun to profit by the lessons he would give her in the art of correct
speech,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_61">{61}</a></span> she would be more of a companion to him, more able to&mdash;well,
converse.</p>

<p>For the moment, he couldn’t disguise from himself, she was weak in
conversation. To look at her, to look at her strangely noble little
head, with everything there that is supposed to go with mind&mdash;the broad
sweep of the brow, the beautifully moulded temples, the radiance in the
eyes, the light that seemed to play over the vivid face with its swiftly
changing expressions, each one more lovely than the last, and the whole
amazing creature a poem of delicate colouring, except where colour had
caught fire and become the flaming wonder of her hair&mdash;to look at this,
and then hear the meagre, the really most meagre and defective
observations that came out of it all, was a surprise. A growing
surprise. Frankly, a growingly painful surprise. Somehow he hadn’t
noticed it before, but now he every hour more plainly perceived a grave
discrepancy between Sally’s appearance and her reality. Or was what he
saw her reality, and what he heard mere appearance?</p>

<p>At night he was sure this was so. Next morning he was afraid it wasn’t.
In any case, she didn’t match.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Curious, thought Jocelyn a day or two later, how completely Sally didn’t
match. Perhaps he was getting livery, and beholding her with a jaundiced
eye. It wouldn’t be surprising if this were so, seeing the reversal of
his ordinary habits that marriage had made. His life till then had been
one of excessive intellectual activity, and excessive sexual inactivity.
Now it was just the opposite. It seemed to him that he was living
entirely on his emotions and his nerves, doing nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_62">{62}</a></span> but make love,
and never thinking a single thought worth thinking. This preoccupation
with Sally’s discrepances, for instance&mdash;what, after all, were a girl’s
discrepances compared to the importance, the interest, of his brain work
till he met her?</p>

<p>He would come down to breakfast, to the sober facts of bacon and grey
morning light, in a highly critical mood, feeling very old, and wise,
and mature, and of course&mdash;there could be no two opinions as to that&mdash;in
everything, except just physical beauty, Sally’s superior. Then she
would come down, and, cautiously saying nothing, smile at him; and he
would be forced, in spite of himself, to wonder, as he gazed at her in a
fresh surprise, whether there could be anything in the world superior to
such beauty. Not himself, anyhow, he thought, with his little inky
ambitions, his desire to express and impress himself, his craving to
find out and do. Sally had no cravings that he could discover; she was
mere lovely acquiescence, content&mdash;and with what exquisiteness&mdash;to be.</p>

<p>Still, in this world one couldn’t just sit silent, and serene, and
wonderful; and the minute circumstances obliged her to say something her
discrepances worried him again. It really was surprising: pure
perfection outside, and inside&mdash;he hated to think it, but more and more
feared he recognised&mdash;pure Pinner. He must take her in hand. He must
teach her, train her in the manners expected in her new sphere of life.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together, and took her in hand. During the second week
after their marriage she was, as it were, almost constantly in hand; and
towards its end Jocelyn’s consciousness of his responsibility and duty,
which at first had faded away in the evening and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_63">{63}</a></span> disappeared entirely
at night, stretched further and further across the day like a
lengthening shadow, till at last it reached right into his very bed. The
image of his mother had begun to loom nearer,&mdash;his mother, whom he had
forgotten in the first fever of passion, but to whom he would
undoubtedly soon now have to show Sally. Show her? Nothing so easy and
sure of its effect as showing Sally, but it was what would happen
immediately after she had been shown that Jocelyn, daily more able to
contemplate Sally objectively as his honeymoon grew longer, began to
consider.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose. He took her in hand. He started by attacking
her h’s, whose absence had early become acutely distressing to him.
Every day he devoted an hour the first thing after breakfast to them,
making her talk to him, to her regret, for she by then well knew that
little good came of talk, and patiently, each time she dropped one,
picking it up and handing it back to her, so to speak, with careful
marginal comments.</p>

<p>He found her most obtuse. Ordinary talk wasn’t enough. He had to invent
sentences, special sentences for her to learn by heart and practise on,
with little pitfalls in their middles which she was to avoid.</p>

<p>She seemed incapable of avoiding anything. Into each pitfall Sally
invariably fell; and unwilling to believe that she couldn’t keep out of
them if she really tried, Jocelyn said the sentences over and over again
to her, obstinately persevering, determined she should learn.</p>

<p><i>Hefty Harry hurries after his hat.</i> Sally drew in long breaths, and
blew them out again at the beginning of each word, hoping they would
turn into h’s, though for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_64">{64}</a></span> the life of her she couldn’t see any
difference between the way she rendered <i>Hefty Harry</i> and the way
Jocelyn did.</p>

<p><i>Husbands inhabit heaven.</i> This was another one, worse than <i>Hefty
Harry</i>, because it wasn’t enough to blow out her breath at the beginning
of each word, but she had somehow to get it out in the middle of the
middle one as well; besides, husbands didn’t inhabit heaven till they
were dead, and Jocelyn’s habit of harping on heaven upset her, for
heaven meant death first, and ever since her mother’s death, at which
Sally had been present, she had had the poorest opinion of the whole
thing.</p>

<p>During the lesson Jocelyn carefully gazed out of the window, keeping his
eyes off her, because this was serious, this was important, and mustn’t
be interfered with by her face. There he sat, patient but determined,
holding her hand so as to reassure her, saying the sentences slowly and
distinctly, while Sally, moist with effort, diligently blew. Why was it
so important? she vaguely wondered. He seemed to love her a lot,
especially in the evenings, and kept on telling her at the times when
his ears were red how happy he was, so what more did he want? What was
the use of bothering over things like h’s, which he declared were there
but of which she could see no sign? She and her father, they had never
worried about them, and they had got along all right. But Sally was
docile; Sally was obedient and goodnatured; Sally earnestly wished to
give people what they wanted; and if what Husband wanted was h’s, then
she would try her utmost to provide them. If only she were quite clear
as to what they were! Perhaps, by plodding, she would some day discover.</p>

<p>She plodded; and the nearest she got to criticism of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_65">{65}</a></span> this new
development in her life was occasionally, when after breakfast Jocelyn
called her over to the window, where he had placed two chairs in
readiness for the lesson and pulled down the blind below the level of
her head, occasionally, very occasionally, to murmur to herself, ‘Them
h’s.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>But it wasn’t only her h’s, it wasn’t only the way she pronounced the
few words that seemed to be at her disposal; there were other things
that disquieted Jocelyn, as he awoke more and more from the wild first
worship of her beauty. He appeared to be surrounded, out of doors and
in, by an increasing number of difficulties. There was that business of
not being able to go out without becoming the instant centre of the
entire attention of St. Mawes,&mdash;most painful to Jocelyn, who had a fixed
notion, implanted in him early in the decent cover of Almond Tree
Cottage, that the truly well-bred were never conspicuous. How
unpleasant, how extraordinarily unpleasant when, the morning lesson over
and the need for exercise imperative, he went round to the garage to
fetch the car, to find on his return the sea-wall opposite their
lodgings black with expectant loungers; how unpleasant, how
extraordinarily unpleasant to have to hurry Sally into the thing, as if
she were the centre figure of a <i>cause célèbre</i> leaving the Law Courts;
and the car, being an old one bought second-hand, sometimes wouldn’t
start&mdash;twice that happened&mdash;and then to see how those loungers sprang
into life and flocked across to help! Jocelyn, used only to quiet
comings and goings and no one taking the least notice of anything he
did, used, in fact to being what<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_66">{66}</a></span> his mother described as well-bred,
felt as if he had suddenly turned into a circus.</p>

<p>And indoors, too, he had difficulties, apart from and in addition to the
difficulties at the lessons, for Sally showed a tendency, mild but
unmistakable, to coalesce with the Cupps. She wanted to help Mrs. Cupp
make the bed in the morning, she tried to clear away the breakfast, so
as to save her feet, as she put it, and once, on some excuse or other,
she actually left Jocelyn by himself in the parlour and got away into
the kitchen, where he found her presently, on going to look, kissing a
fat and hideous child that could only be a little Cupp.</p>

<p>To do her justice Mrs. Cupp in no way that Jocelyn could see encouraged
this; on the contrary, she seemed a particularly stand-offish sort of
woman, who not only knew her own place but knew Sally’s as well, and
wished to keep her in it. Unfortunate that Sally should be, apparently,
so entirely without that knowledge.</p>

<p>Jocelyn did his best to impart it. ‘You belong to me now, Sally,’ he
explained, ‘and my place and sphere is your place and sphere, and my
relations and friends your relations and friends. I don’t go and sit in
kitchens, nor am I friends, beyond what every one is in regard to that
class, with the Cupps. I don’t, and therefore you mustn’t.’</p>

<p>Was this speech snobbish? He hoped not; he trusted not. He despised
snobbishness. His mother had most carefully taught him to. She would
shudder at the mere word, and the shudder had got into his childhood’s
bones.</p>

<p>Sally gave herself great pains to understand, looking at him attentively
while he spoke and coming to the conclusion that what Usband was driving
at was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_67">{67}</a></span> she had got to sit quiet and remember she was now a lady.
She sat quiet, remembering it. She made no attempt at any further
budging from her place, even when Mrs. Cupp dropped things off the
overloaded tray at her very feet, and her fingers itched to pick them
up. She managed not to; she managed to take no notice whatever of them,
and, bending her head over the paper Jocelyn had written her lesson out
on in a fair round hand, would bury herself in it instead, saying it out
loud as he had bidden her, conning it diligently.</p>

<p>The room re-echoed with <i>Hefty Harry</i>, and the deep preliminary drawings
in and blowings out of breaths that were meant to become h’s, and never
did.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was impossible for young Carruthers, having been vouchsafed a vision
of Sally, to stop himself from trying to have another. He was drawn as
by a magnet. His walks, after that Sunday, took him daily down to St.
Mawes, where, having briskly gone the length of the front swinging his
stick, he would lean awhile&mdash;as long as he dared without becoming
conspicuous&mdash;against the sea-wall, smoking and ostensibly considering
the horizon, but really missing nobody who came or went along the road.
The Sealyham Sally was left at home, but other dogs were brought because
they are such wonderful introducers, and the road to acquaintanceship,
young Carruthers knew, is paved with good dogs.</p>

<p>He wasn’t sure that any profit would come of it if he did see the
honeymooners and get into conversation,&mdash;probably not; but he couldn’t
help it; he had to try; he was drawn. And very soon he discovered which
house they were staying in, because the other loungers, smoking and
gazing out to sea, rare figures at ordinary times and scattered sparsely
over a quarter of a mile, were now considerably increased in numbers,
and thickened into a knot at one particular point. That point,
Carruthers unhesitatingly concluded, was where she lived.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<p>Unwilling to be seen doing this sort of thing, he held himself aloof
from the knot, smoking his pipe at a decent distance; but none the less
nothing escaped him that happened at the windows or the door of the
little house. The house, he knew, for his family had lived in the
neighbourhood for many years, was the house of the fisherman Cupp. And
he thought, thrice happy Cupp, and three times thrice happy Mrs.
Cupp,&mdash;for she would be constantly in and out of the very room, and be
able to look at&mdash;no, he wouldn’t, he couldn’t say Sally, not with his
own four-legged Sally so grotesquely profaning the name.</p>

<p>He was all wrong, however, about the Cupps. They were not at all happy;
at least, Mrs. Cupp wasn’t, and unless Mrs. Cupp was happy Cupp, though
he only dimly apprehended this truth and explained the fact of his
discomfort in many ways that were not the right ones, couldn’t be happy
either. For Mrs. Cupp, who beheld Sally with astonishment on her first
appearance, no one in the least like that ever yet having been seen in
St. Mawes, quickly began to have doubts as to whether her lodgers were
married. Everybody in St. Mawes was married, except those who were going
to be or had been, and it disturbed Mrs. Cupp terribly, who all her life
had held her head high and looked people in the face, to think she was
perhaps harbouring and cooking for a person who was neither virgin,
wife, nor widow.</p>

<p>For a brief time, so brief that it could be counted in hours, Sally’s
nightgown had reassured her, because it was essentially the nightgown of
the really married, a nightgown that Mrs. Cupp herself might have worn,
and the most moral laundress had not to blush over. Up to the chin, down
to the toes, long-sleeved, stiff, solid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_70">{70}</a></span> edged at the throat and wrists
with plain scallops, this nightgown did at first help Mrs. Cupp to hope
that her lodgers were all right; but back came her doubts, and more
insistent than before, when she perceived that Cupp too was noticing the
young person’s appearance, and, though he said nothing, was beginning to
behave all sly; and they deepened finally into certainty on her becoming
aware of those thickening clusters of loungers constantly hanging about
opposite her house. Even young Mr. Carruthers. Oh, she saw him plain
enough, and knew all right what he was after; for she hadn’t been to the
pictures over at Falmouth for nothing, and she had learned from them
that that sort of girl got men come buzzing round her as if she were a
pot of honey and they just so many flies. Cupp shouldn’t, though. Cupp
shouldn’t get buzzing. Cupp, after fifteen years of being a steady
husband, wasn’t going to be let buzz&mdash;not much, said Mrs. Cupp to
herself, scouring her kitchen with violence.</p>

<p>She said nothing to him, however, for two, as she would soon show him,
could play at his game of acting sly; but when at the end of the first
fortnight of the Lukes’ stay Jocelyn, on her coming in to clear away the
breakfast, got out his money and was preparing as usual to pay her the
next week’s lodging in advance, she told him without wasting words that
the rooms were let.</p>

<p>‘Let?’ repeated Jocelyn, taken aback.</p>

<p>‘There’s an end to everything,’ said Mrs. Cupp enigmatically, as she
cleared the table with great swift swoops.</p>

<p>‘But,’ protested Jocelyn, annoyed and surprised, ‘we intended to stay at
least another week.’</p>

<p>‘I say there’s an end to everything,’ said Mrs. Cupp<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_71">{71}</a></span> even more
emphatically, crowding the plates noisily on to a tray. ‘And one of
them’s my patience.’</p>

<p>Jocelyn stared. Sally, raising her head from her daily task, on which
she was at that moment engaged, looked on with the air of a mild,
disinterested angel.</p>

<p>‘But what on earth has happened? What’s the matter?’ asked Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘You only got to cast an eye out of the winder to see what’s the
matter,’ said Mrs. Cupp, jerking her elbow in its direction. ‘<i>They</i>
don’t collect like that round parties that’s respectable.’</p>

<p>And dropping some forks off the overloaded tray she clattered out of the
room.</p>

<p>Jocelyn turned swiftly to Sally. ‘You see?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘See wot?’ asked Sally, who was about to stoop and pick up the forks,
but remembered not to just in time.</p>

<p>Yes; see what, indeed. That it was her fault? That this disgrace had
been brought on him through her fault? Was that, Jocelyn asked himself,
shocked at the tempest of injustice that had for an instant swept him
off his feet, what he wanted her to see?</p>

<p>‘I meant,’ he said, ashamed of his unfairness, ‘you heard. You did hear,
didn’t you, what the horrible woman was saying?’</p>

<p>Sally nodded. ‘Thinks we ain’t married,’ she said. She seemed quite
undisturbed. ‘Well, it ain’t much use thinkin’ we ain’t when we are,’
she remarked.</p>

<p>‘Unfortunately she’s sure we’re not, so that we are being turned out,’
said Jocelyn, dropping her hand, which he had taken, for this placidity,
which seemed to him evidence of inability to grasp a situation, instead
of soothing made him angry again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_72">{72}</a></span></p>

<p>He strode across to the window, and grabbing at the blind pulled it down
still lower. How inexpressibly humiliating to be turned out, how
unendurable to have people thinking Sally wasn’t respectable, and that
he, <i>he</i> of all people, would come off with a girl for that sort of
loathsome lark.</p>

<p>‘It ain’t much use bein’ sure, when I got my marriage lines,’ said Sally
with the same calm. ‘Let alone my weddin’ ring.’ And she added
complacently after a minute, ‘Upstairs in my box.’ And after a further
minute, ‘I mean, my marriage lines.’</p>

<p>Then, supposing that the interruption to the lesson might now be
regarded as over, and that it would therefore be expected of her that
she should get on with it, she applied herself once more with patient
industry to her task.</p>

<p>‘<i>H</i>-usbands <i>h</i>-in’abit <i>h</i>-eaven,’ she began again, assiduously
blowing.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my God,’ said Jocelyn, under his breath.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>They left St. Mawes during the dinner hour. When Jocelyn told her they
were going to leave almost at once, and she had better pack, Sally
merely said Right O, and went upstairs to do it.</p>

<p>Right O, thought Jocelyn. Right O. Not a question, not a comment of any
kind. Convenient, of course, in a way, but was this companionship? Could
there be much character behind such resistlessness? Yet if she had asked
questions and made comments he would, he knew, have flown at her; so
that he was being unfair again and unreasonable, and he hated himself.</p>

<p>He usedn’t to be unfair and unreasonable, he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_73">{73}</a></span> standing in front
of the fireless grate, a wrathful eye on the loungers clotted on the
other side of the road; and as for being angry, such a disturbance of
one’s balance, whenever he had observed it in others, had seemed to him
simply the sign of imperfect education. The uneducated were swept by
furies, not scientific thinkers. Now just the contrary was happening,
and the uneducated Sally remained serene, while he was in an almost
constant condition of emotion of one kind or another. Marriage, he
supposed gloomily; marriage. The invasion of the spirit by the flesh. So
absurd, too, the whole thing&mdash;God, how absurd when he thought of it in
the morning, and remembered the cringing worship of the night before.
Absurd, absurd, this nightly abdication of the mind, this abject bowing
down of the higher before the lower.... The worst of it was he didn’t
seem able to help himself. Whatever his theories were in the daytime,
whatever his critical detachment, he only had to be close to Sally at
night....</p>

<p>And in the daytime, instead of at least in the daytime being tranquil
and able to get back his balance, every sort of annoyance crowded on
him. Were all honeymoons like this? Impossible. They hadn’t got Sally in
them. It was Sally who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The door opened, and there she was again, not ten minutes after having
gone up. For Sally’s things being of the kind that are quick to pack,
owing to their fewness, she was ready and down before he had had time,
hardly, to be sure she was going to keep him waiting. So that he
resented this too, because he wasn’t able to be angry with her over
something definite and legitimate. He wanted to have a legitimate excuse
for being angry with her, for it was really all her fault that they had
been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_74">{74}</a></span> insulted and turned out. Of course it was. If he had been with his
mother, Mrs. Cupp would have been deference itself, and that confounded
sea-wall empty. It was all Sally. Looking like that. Looking so
different from any one else. Looking so entirely different from the
accepted idea of a decent man’s wife. Besides, she ought anyhow to have
had more things to pack. That one small tin trunk of hers was a disgrace
to him. Beastly thing, how he hated it. All yellow. He must get her a
proper trunk, and fill it properly, before he could appear with her at
Almond Tree Cottage. There certainly were drawbacks to taking a wife in
her shift, as one’s forbears called it.</p>

<p>Yet, when she came in ready to start, she looked so astonishingly
<i>right</i>, tin trunk or not, and quite apart from her face. She looked
right; her clothes did. She might have been a young duchess, thought
Jocelyn, who had never seen a duchess. He hadn’t an idea how the miracle
was worked. Not by dressmakers and cleverness, of that he was certain,
for the poor Pinners would have to buy clothes off the peg. Perhaps
because she was so reedy tall. Perhaps because of the way she moved.
Perhaps because she was so slender that there hardly seemed to be
anything inside the clothes, and they couldn’t help, left in this way
almost to themselves, hanging in graceful folds. But <i>he</i> knew well
enough what was inside them&mdash;the delicate young loveliness, just
beginning to flower; and at the thought his anger all left him, and he
didn’t care any more about the Cupps or the sea-wall, and the feeling of
humility came over him that came over him each time he saw her beauty,
and he went to her and took both her hands, her little red hands, the
only part of her that had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_75">{75}</a></span> got at by life and spoilt, and kissed
them, and said, ‘Forgive me, Sally.’</p>

<p>‘Wot you been doin’?’ asked Sally, surprised.</p>

<p>‘Not loving you enough,’ said Jocelyn, kissing her hands again.</p>

<p>‘Now <i>don’t</i>,’ said Sally very earnestly, ‘<i>don’t</i> you go thinkin’ that,
now&mdash;&mdash;’ for the idea that she, who had been being loved almost more
than she could stand on this trip, and wouldn’t have been able to stand
if it hadn’t been for knowing it was her bounden duty, might have to be
loved still more if Mr. Luke got it into his head that she ought to be,
excessively alarmed her.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The departure was not unmarked, as is sometimes said, by incident. Cupp,
when the luggage had to be brought down, wasn’t to be found, Mrs. Cupp
seemed incommunicably absorbed over a saucepan, and Jocelyn, with some
sharpness refusing Sally’s help, whose instinct after years spent doing
such things was to lay hold of anything that had to be laid hold of and
drag it, got the tin box and his suitcase downstairs himself, and said
Damn very loud when he knocked his head at the turn of the little
staircase.</p>

<p>Sally heard him, and was enormously surprised and shocked. This was
swearing. This was what she had been most carefully taught to look upon
as real sin. Nothing else had shocked her on the honeymoon, because she
had nothing to go by when it came to husbands other than her father’s
assurance that, except in the daytime, they weren’t gentlemen, and her
own solemn vows in church to obey; but she knew all about swearing. It
was wrong. It was strictly forbidden in God’s Holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_76">{76}</a></span> Word. That and drink
were the two evils spoken of most frequently in her home, and with most
condemnation. They went hand in hand. Drink ruined people; and, on their
way to ruin and when they had got to it, they swore.</p>

<p>This is what Sally had been brought up to believe, so that when,
standing in the doorway of the parlour watching Jocelyn labouring down
the stairs with her trunk and longing to give him a hand, she heard him,
after knocking his head, say a most loud clear damn, she was horrified.
Her husband swearing. And not been drinking, either. Just had his tea as
usual at breakfast, and been with her ever since, so she knew he
couldn’t have. Next thing she’d have to listen to would be God’s name
being taken in vain; and at the thought of that the blood of all the
Pinners, that strictly God-fearing, Sunday-observing, Bible-loving race,
surged to her cheeks.</p>

<p>‘Mr. <i>Luke</i>!’ she exclaimed, throwing his teaching as to the avoidance
of this name to the winds.</p>

<p>‘Hullo?’ said Jocelyn, stopping short on the stairs and peering down at
her round the edge of the tin trunk, arrested by the note in her voice.</p>

<p>‘You didn’t ought to swear,’ said Sally, taking all her courage in both
hands, her face scarlet. ‘There’s no call for it, and you didn’t ought
to swear&mdash;you <i>know</i> you didn’t ought to.’</p>

<p>‘But I only said damn,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Wouldn’t you, if you bashed your
head against this confounded sticking out bit of ceiling?’</p>

<p>‘Mr. <i>Luke</i>!’ cried Sally again, her eyes filling with tears. That he
should not only say bad words himself but think her capable of them....
Often she had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_77">{77}</a></span> bewildered by things he said and did, but now she
looked up at him through the tears in her eyes in a complete
non-comprehension. It was as though she were boxed away from him behind
a great thick wall, or cut off across a great big river, alone on an
island, while he stood far off and unreachable on the opposite bank, and
she had somehow to get to him, to stay close to him, because he was her
husband. Dimly these images presented themselves to her mind, dimly and
confused, but nevertheless producing a very clear anxiety and
discomfort.</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry,’ said Jocelyn, carefully coming down the remaining stairs
and depositing the trunk sideways in the narrow passage, for though the
trunk, as a trunk, was small, the passage, as a passage, was smaller;
and in his turn as he looked at her he grew red, for he had just
remembered that he never said damn in the presence of his mother or of
the other ladies of South Winch, which was a place one didn’t swear in,
however much and unexpectedly he chanced to hurt himself. Was this
<i>laissez aller</i> in Sally’s presence due to his consciousness that she
wasn’t a lady, or due to the fact that she was his wife? Jocelyn
disliked both these explanations, and accordingly, in his turn, grew
red.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Sally,’ he said for the second time within half an hour.</p>

<p>This time she had no doubt as to what had to be forgiven.</p>

<p>‘Promise not to do it no more,’ she begged. ‘Promise now&mdash;do.’</p>

<p>‘Oh Sally, I’ll promise anything, anything,’ said Jocelyn staring at
her, caught again into emotion by the extraordinary beauty of her
troubled face.</p>

<p>‘Father says,’ said Sally, still looking at him through<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">{78}</a></span> tears, ‘that if
somebody swears, then they drinks. An’ if they drinks, then they swears.
An’ it goes ‘and in ‘and, and they don’t stop ever, once they starts,
till they gets to&mdash;&mdash;.’</p>

<p>She broke off, and stood looking at him in silence. The picture was too
awful a one. She couldn’t go on.</p>

<p>‘What do they get to, my angel, my beautiful angel?’ asked Jocelyn,
kissing her softly, not listening any more.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ell,’ whispered Sally.</p>

<p>‘Now <i>you’re</i> swearing,’ murmured Jocelyn dreamily, no longer fully
conscious, shutting her eyes with kisses. ‘Your sweet, sweet eyes,’ he
murmured, kissing them over and over again.</p>

<p>No, Sally couldn’t make head or tail of Mr. Luke. Better not try. Better
give it up. <i>She</i> swearing?</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>She longed very much for the company of Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>‘Father,’ she thought, while Jocelyn was fetching the car, and she was
standing alone in the passage watching the luggage, for she had been
bred carefully never to leave luggage an instant by itself,
‘Father&mdash;<i>’e</i> could tell me.’</p>

<p>What she wanted Mr. Pinner to tell her wasn’t at all clear in her mind,
but she was quite clear that he would tell her if he could, whereas
Jocelyn, who certainly could, wouldn’t. Mr. Luke, she felt in her bones,
even if she had the courage to ask him anything would only be angry with
her because she didn’t already know it; yet how could she know it if
nobody had ever told her? At home they usedn’t to jump down one’s throat
if one asked a question. ‘Snug,’ thought Sally, her head<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_79">{79}</a></span> drooping in
wistful recollection, while with the point of her umbrella she
affectionately stroked the sides of the tin trunk, ‘snug at ’ome in the
shop&mdash;snug at ’ome in the lil’ shop&mdash;’ and whatever else being married
to a gentleman was, it wasn’t snug.</p>

<p>Marriage to a gentleman&mdash;why, you never knew where you were from one
moment to another; nothing settled about it; no cut and come again
feeling; all ups and downs, without, as one might say, any middles; all
either cross looks or, without warning, red ears, kisses, and
oh-Sallyings. It was as if words weren’t the same when a gentleman got
hold of them. They seemed somehow to separate. Queer, thought Sally,
wistfully stroking the tin trunk.</p>

<p>She groped round in her hazy thoughts. She was in a strange country, and
there was a fog, and yet she had somehow to get somewhere. <i>She</i>
swearing?</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The car came round, and Jocelyn came in.</p>

<p>‘Hasn’t Cupp turned up yet?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Sally shook her head.</p>

<p>‘I want him to help me cord the luggage on,’ said Jocelyn, squeezing
past between her and the trunk.</p>

<p>‘I can,’ said Sally.</p>

<p>‘No you can’t,’ snapped Jocelyn, striding to the kitchen door and
opening it.</p>

<p>‘Is Mr. Cupp anywhere about?’ he haughtily asked the figure bent over
the saucepan. He needed his help, or nothing would have induced him to
speak to Mrs. Cupp again.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Mrs. Cupp, without ceasing to stir; but being a good woman,
who tried always to speak the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_80">{80}</a></span> she amplified this into accuracy.
‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>E’s somewhere, but he ain’t about,’ said Mrs. Cupp.</p>

<p>For, having, a short way with her when it came to husbands, she had
turned the key that morning on Cupp while he was still asleep, well
knowing that he wouldn’t dare get banging and shouting lest the
neighbours should find out his wife had locked him in, and his shame
become public. Besides, he was aware of the reason, and would keep quiet
all right, she having had a straight talk with him the night before.</p>

<p>Cupp had been discomfited.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you go thinkin’ you’re goin’ to get adulteratin’ at your age and
after ’avin’ been a decent ’usband these fifteen years,’ said Mrs. Cupp.</p>

<p>’Oo’s been adulteratin’?’ growled Cupp, strong in the knowledge that he
hadn’t, but weak in the consciousness that he would have liked to have.</p>

<p>‘In your ’eart you ’ave, Cupp,’ said Mrs. Cupp, who had her Bible at her
fingers’ ends, ‘and Scripture says it’s the same thing.’</p>

<p>Cupp at this sighed deeply, for he knew it wasn’t.</p>

<p>‘Scripture says,’ said Mrs. Cupp, sitting up very straight in bed and
addressing Cupp’s back as he lay speechless beside her, ‘that ’ooso
looks at a woman an’ lusts after ’er ’as committed adultery with ’er in
’is ’eart. Ain’t you been lookin’ at that there girl and lustin’ after
’er in your ’eart, Cupp? Ain’t you? Why, I <i>seen</i> you. Seen you doin’ it
round doors, seen you doin’ it out of winders. You been adulteratin’ all
over the place. <i>I’ll</i> learn you to get lustin’&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And when she went downstairs in the morning she locked him in.</p>

<p>So Jocelyn had to carry out the luggage himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">{81}</a></span> bidding Sally stay
where she was and wait quietly till he called her, and cording it on
without the assistance, curtly refused, of the loungers against the
sea-wall.</p>

<p>His mother’s luggage on their little holiday jaunts had been so neat, so
easily handled, fixed on in two minutes; but the tin trunk was a
difficult, slippery shape, and anyhow an ignoble object. Every aspect of
it annoyed him. It was like going about with a servant’s luggage, he
thought, wrestling with the thing, which was too high and not long
enough, and refused to fit in with his suitcase.</p>

<p>‘Off?’ inquired one of the loungers affably.</p>

<p>‘Looks like it,’ said Jocelyn, tugging at the cord.</p>

<p>What a question. Silly ass. ‘Do you mind standing a little further
back?’ he said with icy anger. ‘You see, if you come so close I can’t
get&mdash;&mdash;’ he tugged&mdash;‘any&mdash;&mdash;’ he tugged, setting his
teeth&mdash;‘<i>purchase</i>&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Nobody moved; neither the particular lounger he was speaking to, nor the
others.</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, sir,’ said Jocelyn, jerking round furiously, ready to
fight the lot of them.</p>

<p>But they were not attending to him. Their eyes were all fixed on the
parlour window, to which Sally, so anxious not to keep Jocelyn waiting a
minute when he called as to risk disobeying him, had stolen to see how
near ready he was.</p>

<p>There she stood, almost full length, the blind, now that they were
leaving, drawn up, and the sun shining straight on her. St. Mawes had
not had such a chance before. Its other glimpses of her had been
flashes. Nor had the place in all its history ever till now been visited
by beauty. Pretty girls had passed through it and disappeared, or stayed
in it and disappeared equally<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">{82}</a></span> completely because of growing old, and
there was a tradition that in the last century the doctor had had a wife
who for a brief time was very pretty, and during that brief time caused
considerable uproar; but no one living had seen her, it was all hearsay
from the last generation. This at the window wasn’t hearsay. This was
the thing itself, the rare, heavenly thing at its most exquisite moment.
Naturally the loungers took no further heed of Jocelyn; naturally with
one accord they lifted up their eyes, and greedily drank in.</p>

<p>Jocelyn gave the cord one final and very vicious tug, knotted it
somehow, and ran indoors.</p>

<p>‘What on earth you must go and stand at the window for&mdash;&mdash;’ he
exclaimed, hurrying into the room and catching her by the arm. ‘I was
going to fetch you in a minute. Come along, then&mdash;let’s start, let’s get
out of this confounded place. Ready? Got everything? I don’t want any
delays once we’re outside&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Hastily he looked round the room; there was nothing there. Hastily he
looked over Sally; she seemed complete. Then he rushed her out to the
car exactly as if, head downwards, they were both plunging into
something most unpleasant which had to be gone through before they could
escape to freedom.</p>

<p>‘Monstrous, monstrous,’ said Jocelyn to himself. ‘The whole thing is
incredible and fantastic. I might be the impresario of a prima donna or
a cinema star’&mdash;and he remembered, though at the time, like so many
other things, it had drifted past his ears unnoticed, that that
grotesque creature his father-in-law had said Sally had a gift for
collecting crowds.</p>

<p>How painfully true, thought Jocelyn, plunging into the one waiting
outside. What a regrettable gift. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_83">{83}</a></span> all gifts this was the one he
could best have done without in anybody he was obliged to be with; for
he hated crowds, he hated public attention, he was thin-skinned and
sensitive directly anything pulled him out of the happy oblivion of his
work. As far as he had got in life, and it seemed to him a long way, he
judged that quite the best of all conditions was to sit in an eye-proof
shell, invisible to and unconscious of what is usually called the world.
And speculate; and discover; and verify.</p>

<p>Well, no use thinking of that now.</p>

<p>‘Get in, get in,’ he urged under his breath, helping Sally with such
energy that she was clumsier at it than usual. ‘Never mind the rug&mdash;you
can arrange that afterwards. Here&mdash;I’ll hold the umbrella&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>They got off. He could drive perfectly well, yet they got off only after
a series of forward bounds and the stopping of his engine. But they did
get off&mdash;through the loungers, past the windows with heads at them,
round the sharp corner beyond the houses, up the extraordinarily steep
hill.</p>

<p>Sally held her breath. This hill terrified her. Suppose the car, which
each time seemed very nearly to stop on it, stopped quite, couldn’t go
on at all, and they rolled down backwards, down, down, straight into the
sea?</p>

<p>But they reached the top safely. It wasn’t the car that rolled down
backwards that day; it was the tin trunk, and with it Jocelyn’s
suitcase.</p>

<p>Unconscious, they drove on towards Truro.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">They</span> drove in total silence. Jocelyn had much to think of, and not for
anything would Sally have opened her mouth when Mr. Luke’s was shut in
that particular tight line. He had see-sawed back again, she knew, and
was at the opposite end to what she called his oh-Sally condition.
Besides, she never did say anything when she was in the car, however
much he tried to make her, for from the beginning, even before there
were hills, it had frightened her. Cars hadn’t come Mr. Pinner’s way,
and, except for the one drive with Jocelyn that first day of his
courting, she had had no experience of them till now.</p>

<p>This one gave her little joy. It went so fast; it had hairsbreadth
escapes at corners; it had twice run over chickens, causing words with
other angry gentlemen, and it was full inside, where she had to sit, of
important and dangerous-looking handles and pedals that had to have the
rug and her dress and her feet and her umbrella carefully kept clear of
them, or there would be that which she called to herself, catching her
breath with fear, an accident.</p>

<p>Jocelyn had said once, very peremptorily and making hurried movements
with his left hand, ‘For goodness sake don’t let that rug get mixed up
with the gears&mdash;&mdash;’ for the car was a Morris-Cowley, and what Sally
thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_85">{85}</a></span> of with anxiety as them ’andles were between her and Jocelyn,
and it had been enough. The tone of his voice on that occasion had
revealed to her that a combination of rug and gears, and therefore of
anything else and gears, such as dress, feet or umbrella, would be
instantly disastrous, and he never had to say it again.</p>

<p>For the rest of the honeymoon she sat squeezed together as far away from
the alarming things as she could, the rug tucked with anxious care
tightly round her legs, and her feet cramped up in the corner. She was
very uncomfortable, but that mattered nothing to Sally. Even if she
hadn’t been afraid of what might happen, her own comfort, when the
wishes of her elders and betters were in question, wouldn’t have been
given a thought. The Pinners were like that. Their humility and patience
would have been remarkable even in a saint, and as for their bumps of
veneration, they were so big that that country would indeed be easy to
govern which should be populated by many Pinners.</p>

<p>The late Mrs. Pinner, not of course herself a Pinner proper, but of the
more turbulent blood of a race from Tottenham called Skew, had disliked
these virtues in Mr. Pinner, and thought and frequently told him that a
shopkeeper shouldn’t have them at all. A shopkeeper’s job, she often
explained, was to leave off being poor as soon as possible, and Mr.
Pinner never at any time left off being that&mdash;all because, Mrs. Pinner
asserted, he had no go; and having no go was her way of describing
patience and humility. But in Sally, when these qualities began to
appear, she encouraged them, for they made for the child’s safety, they
kept her obedient and unquestioning, they sent her cheerfully to bed
when other girls were going to the pictures, and caused her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_86">{86}</a></span> to be happy
for hours on end by herself in the back parlour performing simple
duties. Besides, though Mrs. Pinner would have been hard put to it to
give it a name, in Sally patience and humility were somehow different
from what they were in Pinner. They held their heads up more. They
didn’t get their tails between their legs. They were in fact in Sally,
though Mrs. Pinner could only feel this dumbly, never getting anywhere
near thinking it, not abject things that quivered in corners, but
gracious things that came to meet one with a smile.</p>

<p>Filled, then, as ever, with these meek virtues, Sally, squeezed into as
little space as possible, and bracing herself, having got safely to the
top of the hill, to meet the next terror, which was the twisty,
slippery, narrow steep road down to the ferry, and the twisty, slippery,
narrow steep road up from it on the other side, and after that the
terror of every corner, round each of which she was sure would lurk a
broad-beamed charabanc,&mdash;was carried in the Morris-Cowley in the
direction of Truro. Here, Jocelyn supposed, they had better stay the
night. Here there were hotels, and he would be able to consider what he
would do next.</p>

<p>He urged the little car along as fast as it would go, for he was
possessed by the feeling that if he only got away fast enough he would
get away altogether. But get away altogether from what? Certainly from
St. Mawes, and Mrs. Cupp, and the loungers who all of course also
supposed he and Sally weren’t married. That was the first, the immediate
necessity. He had not only been turned out, but turned out, he said to
himself, with contumely,&mdash;no use saying it to Sally, because she
wouldn’t know what contumely was, and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_87">{87}</a></span> did seem to him really rather
absurd to be going about with somebody who had never heard even of such
an ordinary thing as contumely.</p>

<p>It wasn’t her fault, of course, but the turning out and the contumely
were obviously because of her; there was no denying that. His mother
would have been sitting in those rooms at this moment, the most prized
and cherished of lodgers. Obviously the whole thing was Sally’s fault,
though he quite admitted she couldn’t help it. But it merely made it
worse that she couldn’t, for it took away one’s confidence in the
future, besides making it unfair to say anything unkind.</p>

<p>Feeling that if he did say anything it might easily be unkind, he kept
his mouth tight shut, and drove in total silence; and Sally, whenever
the road was fairly straight and could be left for a moment unwatched,
looked at him out of the corners of her eyelashes, and was very sorry
for Usband, who seemed upset again.</p>

<p>‘Stomach,’ concluded Sally, who could find no other explanation for
Jocelyn’s ups and downs; and wondered whether she would ever dare bring
to his notice a simple remedy her father, who sometimes suffered too but
with less reserve, always had by him.</p>

<p>Well, there was one thing to be said for all this, thought Jocelyn, his
stern eye fixed straight ahead, his brow severe, as he hurried the car
along the road to the ferry&mdash;he was now awake. At last. High time too.
Till then, from the day he first saw Sally, in spite of moments of grave
spiritual disturbance and annoyance, he had been in a feverish dream.
Out of this dream Mrs. Cupp’s conduct had shaken him, and he believed he
might now be regarded as through with the phase in which he thought of
nothing but the present and let the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_88">{88}</a></span> future go hang. Now he had to
think. Decisions were being forced on him. Holidays end, but life goes
on; honeymoons finish, but wives don’t. Here he was with a wife, and
upon his soul, thought Jocelyn, precious little else,&mdash;no career, no
plans, no lodgings.</p>

<p>What a position. The lodgings, of course, were a small thing, but how
being turned out of them rankled! His life had been so dignified. He and
his mother had never once come across a member of the lower classes who
was rude. At South Winch all was order, decency, esteem in their own set
and respectfulness from everybody else. At Ananias what order, what
decency, what esteem, what respectfulness. Impossible at Ananias,
however modest one might be, not to know that one was looked upon as a
present pride and a future adornment, with the Master at the top of the
scale invariably remembering who one was and graciously smiling, and at
the bottom the almost affectionate attentions of one’s warm and panting
bedmaker. Impossible, too, not to know, though this, except for the
pleasure it gave his mother, was of no sort of consequence, that South
Winch regarded him with interest. These attitudes hadn’t at all
disarranged Jocelyn’s grave balance, hadn’t at all turned his head,
because of his real and complete absorption in his work; but they had
been there&mdash;a fitting and seemly background, a sunny, sheltering wall
against which he could expand, in quiet security, the flowers of his
ambitions.</p>

<p>Now here he was, kicked out into the street&mdash;it amounted to that&mdash;by a
person of the utmost obscurity called Cupp. Conceive it. Conceive having
got into a position in which anybody called Cupp could humiliate him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_89">{89}</a></span></p>

<p>He banged his fist down on the electric horn as an outlet to his
feelings. It gave a brief squeak, and was silent.</p>

<p>‘Horn’s gone wrong,’ he said, pressing it hard but getting nothing more
out of it.</p>

<p>Sally’s heart gave a thump. To have anything go wrong at such a moment!
For they were on that road cut in the hillside, narrow, twisty, slippery
and steep, which leads on the St. Mawes side down through a wood,
charming that late March afternoon with the mild sun slanting through
the pale, grey-green branches of naked trees across flocks of primroses,
to the King Harry Ferry. Far down on Sally’s side she could have seen,
if she had dared look, the placid waters of the Fal, unruffled in their
deep shelter by the wind that was blowing along the open country at the
top. Her anxious eyes, however, were not in search of scenery&mdash;at no
time was she anything of a hand at scenery,&mdash;they were strained towards
each fresh corner as it came in sight; for one day they had met a
charabanc round one of those very corners, a great wide horror taking up
nearly all the road. But luckily that day they were coming up the hill,
not going down it, and so they had the inside, and not the unprotected,
terrifying outside edge. Now they were outside, and suppose....</p>

<p>‘Horn’s gone wrong,’ said Jocelyn, just as she was thinking that.</p>

<p>But did it matter? she asked herself, seeking comfort. She tried to hope
it didn’t. Horns weren’t like wheels. One didn’t depend on them for
getting along. They just made noises. Useful, as one’s voice was useful,
but not essential, like one’s legs.</p>

<p>No, it didn’t matter much, evidently, for Usband was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">{90}</a></span> saying he would
put it right while they were on the ferry,&mdash;and then her heart gave a
much bigger thump, and seemed to leap into her mouth and crouch there
trembling, for there, round the very next corner, a few yards in front
of them, was another charabanc.</p>

<p>‘My gracious goodness,’ thought Sally, the colour ebbing out of her face
as she stiffened in her seat and held on tighter. ‘My gracious
<i>goodness</i>&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But it was going down too; thank heaven it was going down too&mdash;making,
even as they were making, for the ferry.</p>

<p>Jocelyn banged again on his horn, which gave another weak squeak and
then was silent.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ’e ain’t goin’ to try and pass it? ’E ain’t goin’ to try and pass
it?’ Sally asked herself, clutching the side of the car.</p>

<p>The charabanc, however, was unaware that anything had come down the hill
behind it, and continued in the middle of the narrow road; and to
Sally’s relief Jocelyn stole quietly along close up to its back, for he
thought that if he kept right up against it and made no noise the people
in it wouldn’t be able to see Sally, and he wouldn’t have to sit there
impotently watching the look spreading over their faces when they caught
sight of her that by now he knew only too well.</p>

<p>All went smoothly till they were on the ferry. The charabanc drove
straight to the farther end of it, and Jocelyn slipped along close
behind, and then, getting out, still unobserved, opened his bonnet and
began to deal with the horn.</p>

<p>He had no side-horn with him. It had been removed by an idiot who lived
on his staircase at Ananias, and who constantly saw fun where no one
else did. He saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_91">{91}</a></span> fun in removing Jocelyn’s horn; and though on serious
representations being made he restored it, it hadn’t been fixed on
again, because Jocelyn soon after that met Sally, and everything else
was blotted from his mind. Now he remembered it, and cursed the silly
idiot through whose fault it wasn’t at that moment on the car. Still, he
would soon set the electric one right; there couldn’t be much the matter
with it.</p>

<p>He proceeded, his head inside the bonnet, to set it right, and Sally,
feeling safe for a bit with Jocelyn outside the car, looked on
sympathetically. She wanted to help, if only by holding something, but
knew she mustn’t move. The back of the great charabanc towered above
their little two-seater as the stern of a liner towers above a tug. All
was quiet up there. The tops of the heads of the last row of passengers
were motionless, their owners no doubt being engaged in contemplating
the scenery of the Fal.</p>

<p>Then suddenly under Jocelyn’s manipulations the horn began to blow, and
the row of heads, startled into attentiveness by this unexpected
shrieking immediately underneath them, turned and peered down over the
edge of the charabanc’s back. Then they saw Sally, and their peering
became fixed.</p>

<p>But Jocelyn had no time for that now; what was of importance at the
moment was that the horn wouldn’t stop. It shrieked steadily; and though
he leapt backwards and forwards from the part of it that was in the
bonnet to the part of it that was on the steering-wheel and did things
rapidly and violently in both places, it went on shrieking.</p>

<p>Here was a nice thing, he thought, to happen to a man whose one aim was
to be unnoticed. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_92">{92}</a></span> fortunate that the noise drowned what he was
saying, for so Sally hadn’t the shock of hearing him break his recent
promise; and, much surprised at the conduct of the horn, she was shaken
out of her usual prudent silence and was moved to draw Jocelyn’s
attention to its behaviour by remarking, on one of his flying visits to
the steering wheel, that it wasn’t half hollering.</p>

<p>‘Oh, shut <i>up</i>!’ cried Jocelyn, beside himself; and who knows whether he
meant Sally or the horn?</p>

<p>Sally took it that he was addressing the horn, and observed
sympathetically that it didn’t seem to want to.</p>

<p>‘If only I had a small screwdriver!’ cried Jocelyn, frantically throwing
out the contents of his tool-box in search of what wasn’t there. ‘I
don’t seem to have a small screwdriver&mdash;a <i>small</i> screwdriver&mdash;has
anybody got a <i>small</i> screwdriver?’</p>

<p>The ferryman had no screwdriver, big or small, and the driver of the
charabanc, descended from his place to come and look on, had none small
enough; while as for the passengers, now all standing on their seats and
craning their necks, nothing was to be expected of them except
absorption in Sally.</p>

<p>‘Scissors would do&mdash;scissors, scissors!’ cried Jocelyn, who felt that if
the horn didn’t stop he would go mad.</p>

<p>Nobody had any scissors except Sally, who got on her feet quickly and
delightedly, because now she could help&mdash;the heads craned more than
ever&mdash;and said she had a pair at the bottom of her trunk.</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ said Jocelyn, unable even for the sake of perhaps stopping the
horn to face uncording and unpacking before the whole ferry that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">{93}</a></span>terrible tin trunk of hers. ‘Sit still, Sally&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he began to hit whatever part seemed nearest to the noise with his
clenched fist.</p>

<p>‘<i>That</i> won’t do no good,’ said the driver of the charabanc, grinning.</p>

<p>The grin spread to the face of the ferryman, and began to appear on the
faces piled up over the top of the charabanc.</p>

<p>Jocelyn saw it, and suddenly froze into icy impassiveness. Whatever the
damned horn chose to do he wasn’t going to provide entertainment for a
lot of blasted trippers. Besides&mdash;was he losing his temper? He, who had
supposed for years that he hadn’t got one?</p>

<p>He slammed the bonnet to, flung the tools back into their box, got into
his seat again, and sat waiting to drive off the ferry with a completely
expressionless face, just as if nothing at all were happening; and
Sally, deluded by his calm into supposing that he thought the horn was
now all right, after waiting a moment anxiously and seeing that he
didn’t do anything more, nudged him gently and told him it was still
blowing.</p>

<p>‘Is it?’ said Jocelyn; and there was something in the look he gave her
that made her more sure than ever that speech with Usband was a mistake.</p>

<p>It blew all the way to Truro. That was the nearest place where the thing
could be taken to a garage, and kicked to pieces if nothing else would
stop it. For ten miles it blew steadily. They streamed, shrieking, along
the lanes and out on to the main road. The drive was a nightmare of
astonished faces, of people rushing out of cottages, of children
shouting, of laughter flashing and gone, to be succeeded by more and
more, till the whole of every mile seemed one huge exclamation.</p>

<p>Sally squeezed terror-stricken into her corner. Such<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_94">{94}</a></span> speed as this she
had never dreamed of, nor had it ever yet been got out of the
Morris-Cowley. She could only cling and hope. The noise was deafening.
The little car leapt into the air at every bump in the road. Jocelyn’s
face was like a marble mask. The charabanc, being bound for Falmouth,
turned off to the left at the main road, and the passengers rose as one
man in their seats and waved handkerchiefs of farewell; while Sally,
even at such a moment unable not to be polite, let go the side of the
car an instant to search with trembling fingers for her handkerchief and
wave it back.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>At Truro he stopped at the first garage he saw, a small one in the
outlying part of the town, where there were few passers-by. The few
there were, however, immediately collected round the car that swooped
down the hill on them hooting, and still went on hooting in spite of
having stopped.</p>

<p>How simple, if it had been his mother who was with him, to have asked
her to walk on to an hotel or a confectioner’s, and wait for him while
he had the horn seen to. She would have proceeded through the town
unobserved and unmolested, and the hotel or confectioner would have
received her without curiosity, and attended respectfully to her wants.
Or she might have waited in the car, and there too she would have
aroused neither interest nor comment. A lady, you see. A lady, turning,
like a decent Italian house, her plain and expressionless side to the
public of the street, and keeping her other side, her strictly private
and delightful other side, for her family and friends.</p>

<p>He hurried Sally into the garage, into the furthermost<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_95">{95}</a></span> depths of the
garage. Not for her, he felt, were quiet walks alone through streets and
unquestioning acceptance at hotels; not for him the convenience, the
comfort, of a companion who in a crisis needn’t be bothered about, who
automatically became effaced. Nothing effaced Sally. Her deplorable
conspicuousness made it impossible for her to go anywhere without him.
She had to be accompanied and protected as watchfully as if she were the
Crown Jewels. Yes, or a perambulator with a baby in it that could never
be left alone for an instant, and was always having to be pushed about
by somebody. That somebody was himself, Jocelyn Luke; Jocelyn Luke, who
as recently as a month ago was working away, hopeful and absorbed,
immersed in profoundly interesting and important studies, independent,
with nothing at all to trammel him or hinder him&mdash;with, on the contrary,
everything and everybody conspiring to leave him as untrammelled and
unhindered as possible. What was he now? Why, the perambulator’s
nursemaid. Just that: the perambulator’s attendant nursemaid.</p>

<p>This seemed to Jocelyn fantastic.</p>

<p>‘Wait here, will you?’ he said, hurrying her into the garage and
depositing her like a parcel in the remotest corner. ‘Don’t move, will
you, till I fetch you&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he left her there, safe as far as he could see, and went back to the
shrieking car.</p>

<p>She sat down thankfully on a pile of empty petrol cans. If only she
could be left there for a good long while, if only she could spend the
rest of the day there.... ‘Don’t move,’ Usband had said; as though she
wanted to! Except that she was very hungry, really hungry now that her
fears were over, for she had had no dinner yet, and it was two o’clock,
how happy would she<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_96">{96}</a></span> have been to stay there without moving for the rest
of the afternoon. The quiet corner, away from danger, away from having
to guess what she ought to say to Usband, and away from the look he gave
her when she had said it, seemed almost perfect. It would have been
quite perfect if there had been anything to eat.</p>

<p>And as if in answer to her wish, the little door into a shed at the back
opened, and in walked a youth, smudged and pasty-looking as those look
who work much in garages, bearing in his hand a basin tied up in a
crimson handkerchief.</p>

<p>This was young Mr. Soper, the most promising of the mechanics employed
at the garage, who daily ate his dinner in that corner. There he could
sit on the pile of empty petrol cans, out of sight and yet within
earshot should his services suddenly be called for; and on this
particular day, his firm having been by chance extra busy all the
morning, he had gone later than usual into the private shed at the back
to fetch the basin of food left there for him by his landlady’s little
son, so that when Jocelyn took Sally into the corner it was empty,
because Mr. Soper, instead of being in the middle of his dinner as he
would have been on other days, was in the act of collecting it in the
shed.</p>

<p>‘Beg pardon, Miss,’ he said, staring at Sally, his mouth dropping open.
‘Beg pardon, I’m sure, Miss&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he put his arm quickly back round the door he had just come through
and whipped out a chair. ‘Won’t you&mdash;won’t you sit more comfortable,
Miss?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t mind if I do,’ said Sally, getting up and smiling politely.</p>

<p>Mr. Soper’s pasty face became bright red at that smile. He proceeded to
dust the seat of the chair by rubbing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">{97}</a></span> bottom of his handkerchiefed
basin up and down it, and then stood staring at the young lady, the
basin dangling sideways in his hand, held carelessly by the knotted
corners of its handkerchief, and some of its gravy accordingly dribbling
out.</p>

<p>‘It do smell nice, don’t it,’ remarked Sally as she sat down, unable to
refrain from sniffing.</p>

<p>‘What do, Miss?’ asked Mr. Soper, recognising with almost incredulous
pleasure a manner of speech with which he was at his ease.</p>

<p>‘Wot you got in that there basin,’ said Sally, also recognising, and
also with pleasure, accents since her marriage become very dear to her
because reminiscent of home.</p>

<p>She smiled with the utmost friendliness at him. Mr. Soper found it
difficult to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>‘It’s my dinner,’ said Mr. Soper, gazing at the vision.</p>

<p>‘Well, I didn’t suppose it was your Sunday ’at,’ said Sally, pleased to
find that she too, given a chance, could say clever things. ‘Tell by the
smell it ain’t a nat.’</p>

<p>Mr. Soper also seemed to think this clever, for he laughed, as Sally put
it to herself, like anything.</p>

<p>‘Stew?’ she asked, her delicate nose describing little half circles of
appreciative inquiry.</p>

<p>‘That’s right,’ said Mr. Soper. ‘Irish.’</p>

<p>‘Thought so,’ said Sally; and added with a sigh, ‘the best of the lot.’</p>

<p>Mr. Soper being intelligent, though handicapped at the moment by not
quite believing his eyes, thought he here perceived encouragement to
untie the handkerchief. He put the basin on the floor at the young
lady’s feet, and untied it. She gazed at the lovely contents, at
potatoes showing their sleek sides through the brimming<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_98">{98}</a></span> gravy, at
little ends of slender cutlets, at glimpses of bright carrots, at
pearly-shouldered onions gleaming from luscious depths, with such
evident longing that he was emboldened to ask her if she wouldn’t oblige
him by tasting it, and telling him her opinion of it as a stew.</p>

<p>‘There’s stews and stews, you know, Miss,’ he said, hastily arranging it
on an empty packing-case convenient for her, ‘but my old woman’s who
looks after me is ’ard to beat&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he ran into the little shed he had come out of, and after a minute’s
rummaging brought her a spoon and plate. His own spoon was in his
pocket. He didn’t use a plate.</p>

<p>Sally tasted; and, having tasted, went on tasting. Soon there was danger
that Mr. Soper’s dinner would be so much tasted that there wouldn’t be
any left, but he cared nothing for that. If he had had a hundred stews,
and he starving, they should all have been the young lady’s.</p>

<p>Sally tried not to taste too much, but she was so hungry, and the stew
was so lovely. Besides, the young man kept urging her to go on. He was
more like a friend than any one she had yet met. That he should never
take his eyes off her didn’t disturb her in the least, for she had been
used to that all her life; and his language was her language, and he
didn’t make her feel nervous, and she knew instinctively that she could
do nothing wrong in his sight, and she talked more to him during the
half hour they ate the stew together&mdash;for she presently insisted on his
getting another plate and joining in&mdash;than she had talked to Jocelyn the
whole time they had known each other; talked more to him, indeed, than
she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">{99}</a></span> ever talked to anybody, except, when she was little, to those
girl friends who had later fallen away.</p>

<p>How surprising, how delightful, the ease with which she said things to
Mr. Soper, and the things that came into her head to say! Quite clever,
she was; quite sharp, and quick at the take-up. And laugh&mdash;why, the
young fellow made her laugh so that she could hardly keep from choking.
Not in all her life had she laughed as Mr. Soper made her laugh. Bright,
he was, and no mistake. While as for Mr. Soper himself, who could be
much, much brighter, he was fortunately kept damped down to his simpler
jokes by the effect the strange young lady’s loveliness had on him; so
that he who in Truro was known as the life of his set, as the boldest of
its wits as well as the most daring of its ladies’ men, was as mild and
timid in his preliminary frisks with Sally as a lately born lamb
exploring, for the first time, the beautiful strange world it had
suddenly discovered.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Jocelyn found them there, the empty basin on the floor between them,
and, sticking up in it, two spoons.</p>

<p>‘My ’usband,’ introduced Sally, starting a little, for she had forgotten
Jocelyn; and Mr. Soper had what he afterwards described as the turn of
his life.</p>

<p>She with a husband? She who was hardly old enough, if you asked him, to
have a father even? Got a husband all the time, and eaten his stew. He
didn’t grudge her the stew, but he did think she ought to have told him
she had a husband. Fancy eating his stew, and knowing she had a husband
the whole time. It seemed to make it unfair. It seemed to make it
somehow false pretences. And one of these blinking gentlemen, too; one
of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_100">{100}</a></span> haw-haw chaps with the brains of a rabbit, thought Mr. Soper,
looking Jocelyn up and down, who took no notice of him whatever. See
that written all over him, thought Mr. Soper, seeking comfort in
derision,&mdash;a silly fool who couldn’t even mend his own horn. Wicked, he
called it, wicked, to thieve this girl away from her own lot, filch her,
before she knew what she was about, from her natural mates, go-ahead
chaps like, for instance, himself, when there were thousands of female
rabbits in his own class who would have fitted him like so many blooming
gloves.</p>

<p>‘Class should stick to class,’ said Mr. Soper to himself, who belonged
to at least four societies for violently welding all classes into one,
the one being Mr. Soper’s.</p>

<p>Jocelyn ignored him. (‘Haw, haw,’ thought Mr. Soper derisively, hurt by
this, and sticking out a chin that no one noticed.) Shutting his eyes to
the hideous evidence of the two spoons in the basin, to which he would
refer, he decided, later, he took Sally’s arm and hurried her out to the
now silent Morris-Cowley. This had not been his intention when he came
in. He had intended to tell her that he had just discovered the loss of
the luggage, that he was going back at once to look for it, and leave
her there, where she was safe and private, till he came back.</p>

<p>The sight of the basin and spoons forced him to other decisions. She was
obviously neither safe nor private. He said nothing at all, but gripping
her arm with, perhaps, unnecessary vigour seeing how unresistingly she
went, hurried her out of the place and helped her, again with, perhaps,
unnecessary vigour into her seat, slamming the door on her and hastening
round to the other side to his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Soper, however, was hard on their heels. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_101">{101}</a></span> if not nippy, he
was determined to see the last of her who not only was the first human
being he had met to whom he could imagine going down on his knees, but
also&mdash;thus did romance and reality mingle in his mind&mdash;who contained at
that moment at least three-quarters of his Irish stew. It seemed to give
him a claim on her. Inside himself was the remaining quarter, and it did
seem to unite them. Mortified as he was, deceived as he felt himself to
be, he yet couldn’t help, in his mind, making a joke about this union,
which he thought so good that he decided to tell it to his friends that
night at the whist-drive he was going to&mdash;it need not be repeated
here,&mdash;and he was so excessively nippy, such a very smart, all-there,
seize-your-opportunity young man, that he actually managed to say in
Sally’s left ear during the brief moment Jocelyn was on his way round to
the other side, bending down ostensibly to examine the near back tyre,
‘Whatever did you want to go and marry one of them haw-haw fellers for,
when there was&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But what there was Sally never heard, for at that instant the car leaped
forward, leaving him on the kerb alone.</p>

<p>There he stood, looking after it; apparently merely a pale, contemptuous
mechanic, full of the proper scorn for a shabby little four-year-old
two-seater&mdash;he could of course date it exactly&mdash;but really a baffled
young man who had just been pulled up and thwarted in the very act of
falling, for the first time in his life, passionately and humbly in
love.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The Thistle and Goat was where Jocelyn took her. It was the first hotel
he saw. He had to deposit her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">{102}</a></span> somewhere; he couldn’t take her with him
in search of the luggage, and have her hanging round while he picked it
up and corded it on again, and making friends with anybody who came
along. Would she obey him and stay in the bedroom, or would he be forced
to the absurdity of locking her in? He was so seriously upset by the
various misfortunes of the day that he was ready to behave with almost
any absurdity. He was quite ready, for instance, to fight that spotted
oaf at the garage; he had itched to knock him down, and had only been
restrained by a vision of the crowd that would collect, and a
consciousness of how it would advertise Sally. To lock her in her room
was, he admitted, a violent sort of thing to do, and violence, he had
been brought up to believe, was always vulgar and ridiculous, but it
would anyhow be effective. Definite and strongly simple measures were,
he perceived, needful with Sally, especially when one was in a hurry. He
couldn’t, with the luggage lying somewhere on the road between Truro and
St. Mawes, probably burst open and indecently scattered and exposed,
start explaining to Sally all the things she was on no account to do
while he was away collecting it. He certainly would explain; and fully;
and clearly; for the spoon and basin business had been simply
disgusting, and he was going to put a stop to that sort of thing once
and forever, but not now,&mdash;not till there was plenty of time, so that he
really might have a chance of getting into her head at least the
beginning of a glimmer of what a lady simply couldn’t do. And he was so
angry that he corrected this sentence, and instead of the word lady
substituted the wife of a gentleman.</p>

<p>He locked her in.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p>‘If any one knocks,’ he told her before leaving her, ‘you will call out
that you have locked the door, as you wish to be undisturbed. You
understand me, Sally? That’s what you are to say&mdash;nothing else. Exactly
and only that.’</p>

<p>‘Right O,’ said Sally, a little dejectedly, for his tone and expression
discouraged cheerfulness, and preparing to lock the door behind him.</p>

<p>But it was he who locked it, much to her surprise, deftly pulling the
key out of the inside of the door and slipping it into the outside
before she realised what he was doing; and she heard him, having turned
it, draw it out and go away.</p>

<p>Yes, she was locked in all right.</p>

<p>‘Whatever&mdash;&mdash;’ began Sally in her thoughts; then gave it up, and sat
down patiently on the edge of the wicker arm-chair to wait for the next
thing that would happen to her.</p>

<p>‘Glad I ’ad that there stew,’ she reflected.</p>

<p>‘My wife,’ said Jocelyn to the lady in the office downstairs, as he went
out still with the frown on his face caused by the realisation that he
hadn’t given Sally any reason for his suddenly leaving her, and that she
hadn’t asked for any&mdash;was that companionship?&mdash;‘wishes to be undisturbed
till I come back.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> see,’ said the lady, with what seemed to him rather a curious
emphasis, and she was about to inquire where his luggage was, for the
Thistle and Goat liked to know where luggage was, when he strode away.</p>

<p>Now what did she see, Jocelyn asked himself. Nobody had ever said <i>I</i>
see like that to any orders given when he was travelling with his
mother. The emphasis was marked. It sounded, he thought, both
suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_104">{104}</a></span> and pert. He went out to the car, strangling a desire to go
back and ask her what she saw. Did she too think he wasn’t really
married? No, no&mdash;nonsense. Probably she saw and meant nothing. Really he
was becoming sensitive beyond all dignity, he thought as he drove off on
his unpleasant and difficult quest.</p>

<p>But the lady in the office had merely expressed herself badly. What was
worrying her was not what she saw but what she didn’t see, and what she
didn’t see was luggage. The Thistle and Goat, in common with other
hotels, liked luggage. It preferred luggage to be left rather than
ladies. Now the gentleman had gone off without saying a word about it,
and she tried to reassure herself by hoping, what was indeed true, that
he had gone to fetch it, and that she need do nothing about it, anyhow
for the present. And hardly had she settled down to a cup of
after-luncheon tea in the back office when the luggage arrived, brought
in by a different gentleman, and one, to her great relief, whom she
knew&mdash;young Mr. Carruthers, of Trevinion Manor.</p>

<p>Great was the confidence the Thistle and Goat had in the family of
Carruthers, whom it had known all its life. No orders given by a passing
tourist could have any weight when balanced against a Carruthers
request. So that when young Mr. Carruthers, learning that Mr. Luke had
lately left in his car, asked to see Mrs. Luke in order to hand over her
luggage personally and desired his card to be sent up, regardless of the
orders given by Mr. Luke the card was sent up and the message given; and
Sally received both it and the message, for the chambermaid, finding the
door locked and getting no answer, because Sally thought that by saying
nothing she wouldn’t be telling any lies, unlocked it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_105">{105}</a></span> with her
pass-key; and Sally, having heard the message and received the card,
issued forth obediently. Naturally she did. Usband had said nothing
about not leaving the room. She wanted her tin box, and to get unpacked.
Besides, when anybody sent for her she always went.</p>

<p>What had happened was that young Carruthers, strolling down as usual
just before lunch across the fields to the sea-front, had found the
window of the Cupp parlour flung wide open, and Mrs. Cupp vigorously
shaking the hearth-rug out of it. Evidently her lodgers had left; and he
went in and began asking her about them, and very soon discovered that
the lean chap was Jocelyn Luke&mdash;Luke of Ananias, as Carruthers, himself
at Oxford, instantly identified him, for there couldn’t well be two
Jocelyn Lukes, and his reputation had ebbed across to Oxford, where he
was known not unfavourably, and perhaps as on the whole the least
hopelessly unpromising of the Cambridge crowd. And just as Mrs. Cupp was
proceeding to tell him her opinion of the alleged Mrs. Luke, and how
Cupp had only now been able to come out of his bedroom and have his
dinner, there came news of the dropped luggage on the hill.</p>

<p>Carruthers felt that he was the very man to deal with that. He rushed
off, thrust everybody aside, collected it reverently, for the tin trunk
had indeed burst open, and its modest contents, of a touching propriety
he thought, as he carefully put back things that felt like flannel, were
scattered on the road, and then, fetching his car, took it into Truro.</p>

<p>It was easy, at the turn to Falmouth, to discover which way the Lukes
had gone. It was also easy, on arriving in Truro, to discover which
hotel they were in.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_106">{106}</a></span> He only had to describe them. Everybody had noticed
them. Everybody on the road had heard their horn, and everybody had seen
the beautiful young lady. And because he went into the town by the
direct road, and as Jocelyn coming out of it, and sure the luggage
hadn’t anyhow been dropped nearer than the top of the hill beyond the
garage, took a round-about way, joining the main road only on the other
side of the garage so as not again to have to set eyes on the loathsome
oaf employed in it and risk being unable to resist going in and knocking
him down, they missed each other precisely there; and accordingly when
Jocelyn, having been all the way to St. Mawes, where he heard what had
been done, got back about five, tired, very hungry, and wondering how on
earth he was now going to find the officious person they said was trying
to restore his belongings to him, he was told by the boots that young
Mr. Carruthers had arrived just after he left, and was waiting to see
him upstairs in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘Thank heaven,’ thought Jocelyn, feeling the key in his pocket, ‘that I
locked her in.’</p>

<p>And he went into the drawing-room, and there at a table in a corner by
the fire, with the remains on it of what seemed to have been an
extraordinarily good and varied tea, she was sitting.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Carruthers&mdash;he recognised him at once as the man with the dog called
Sally&mdash;was worshipping her. Decently, for Carruthers was plainly a
decent chap, but worshipping her all right; it was written in every line
and twist of him, as he leaned forward eagerly, telling her stories,
apparently, for he was talking a great deal and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_107">{107}</a></span> she was only
listening,&mdash;amusing stories, for she was smiling.</p>

<p>She never smiled with him, thought Jocelyn; not like that, not a real
smile of just enjoyment. From the very first day, that day at tea in the
Pinner parlour, she had seemed frightened of him. But she couldn’t be
much frightened, for here she was openly disregarding his injunctions,
and somehow got out of her locked room. That seemed to Jocelyn anything
but being frightened; it seemed to him to the last degree fearless and
resourceful. And how strangely at variance with her apparent shyness and
retiringness that twice in one day she should have allowed strange men
to feed her.</p>

<p>He approached their corner, pale and grim. He was tired to death after
the vexatious day he had had, and very hungry after not having had
anything to eat since breakfast. Carruthers had watched his opportunity,
of course&mdash;waited somewhere till he had seen him go, and then taken the
luggage in and asked for Sally. And Sally, somehow getting out of that
room, had defied his orders and come down. Well, he couldn’t do anything
with her at that moment. He was too tired to flare up. Besides&mdash;scenes;
he couldn’t for ever make scenes. What a revolting form of activity to
have thrust upon him! But the amount of ideas that would, he perceived,
have to be got into her head if life was to be even approaching
tolerable was so great that his mind, in his fatigued state, refused to
consider it.</p>

<p>She saw him first, and, much pleased with everything, with the beautiful
tea, with Mr. Carruthers’ funny stories and with her pleasant afternoon
altogether, continued to smile, but at him now, and said to Carruthers,
‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ere comes Mr. Luke.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_108">{108}</a></span>’</p>

<p>And on Carruthers getting up and Jocelyn arriving at the table,
introduced them.</p>

<p>‘My ’usband,’ introduced Sally; explaining Carruthers to Jocelyn by
saying, ‘The gentleman as brought our traps.’</p>

<p>Jocelyn couldn’t be angry with Carruthers; he looked at him so
friendlily, and shook his hand with what surely was a perfectly sincere
heartiness. And though he was obviously bowled over by Sally&mdash;naturally,
thought Jocelyn, seeing that he had none of the responsibility and only
the fun&mdash;there was something curiously sympathetic in his attitude to
Jocelyn himself, something that seemed, oddly, to understand.</p>

<p>Sally, his wife, said, for instance, ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ad yer tea?’&mdash;just that, and made
no attempt to give him any. But what Carruthers said, quickly going
across and ringing the bell, was, ‘I bet you haven’t. You’ve had the
sort of rotten day there’s no time for anything in but swearing. They’ll
bring some fresh stuff in a moment. It’s a jolly good tea they give one
in this place,&mdash;don’t they, Mrs. Luke.’</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span><i>Eav</i>enly,’ said Sally. And turning to Jocelyn she said, more timidly,
‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ad to come out of the bedroom. The servant&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s all right,’ interrupted Jocelyn hastily, earnestly desiring
to keep from Carruthers the knowledge that he had locked her in. Things
look so different, especially domestic actions, in the eyes of a third
person unaware of the attendant circumstances, thought Jocelyn.</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair. What a comfort it was, after a fortnight of
being dog alone with Sally, to hear that decent voice. It really was
like music. He hadn’t,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_109">{109}</a></span> at Cambridge, cared much for the Oxford way of
speaking, but how beautiful it seemed after the Pinner way. He wanted to
shut his eyes and just listen to it. ‘Go on, go on,’ he wanted to say,
when Carruthers paused for a moment in his pleasant talk; and he sat
there, listening and eating and drinking in silence, and Carruthers
looked after him, and fed him, and talked pleasantly to him, and talked
pleasantly to Sally as well, and did, in fact, all the talking. There
was something about Jocelyn that made Carruthers feel maternal. He was
so thin. His shoulder blades stuck out so, and his lean, nervous face
twitched. Carruthers thought, as he had thought on that first occasion,
only this time, knowing who he was and aware of Sally’s class, with ten
times more conviction, ‘Poor devil’; but he also thought, his eyes
resting on the lovely thing in the corner&mdash;he had established her in the
farthermost corner of the Thistle and Goat’s drawing-room, for he too
had instantly begun to hide her, and she lit up its gloom as a white
flower lights up the dusk&mdash;he also thought, ‘Poor angel.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Yes, she was an angel, and a poor one; he was sure of that. Carruthers,
so romantic inside, so square and unemotional outside, told himself she
was a forlorn child-angel torn out of her natural heaven, which
obviously was completely h&mdash;less and obscure, but comfortable and
unexacting, and pitched into a world of strangers, the very ABC of whose
speech and behaviour she didn’t understand.</p>

<p>After two hours <i>tête à tête</i> with Sally, two hours which seemed like
ten minutes, so deeply was he interested, this was his conclusion. She
hadn’t been very shy, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_110">{110}</a></span> after he left off being shy, which he was for
a moment or two, confused by the sheer shock of her beauty seen close;
but he had soon recovered and got into his stride, which was an easy one
for her to keep up with, his one idea being to please her and make her
happy.</p>

<p>It wasn’t difficult to please Sally and make her happy; you had only to
avoid frightening her. Mr. Soper hadn’t frightened her, he had fed
her,&mdash;always a good beginning with a woman. Carruthers knew this, and
immediately ordered tea, in spite of its still being only three o’clock;
and, since the Thistle and Goat specialised in teas, the one which was
presently brought was of such a conspicuous goodness, with so many
strange Cornish cakes and exciting little sandwiches, besides a bowl of
the Cornish cream Sally liked altogether best of anything she had
learned to know on her honeymoon, that she soon felt as comfortable and
friendly with Carruthers as she had with Mr. Soper.</p>

<p>She was at the age of jam. Cream was still enough to make her happy. And
she wasn’t used to quantities. In her frugal life there had never been
quantities of anything, and they excited her. Quantities combined with
kindness&mdash;what could be more delightful? She didn’t suppose she had
enjoyed anything so much ever as that tea. And it was sheer enjoyment,
nothing to do with hunger at all, for hunger had been done away with by
Mr. Soper’s stew, and this was a deliberate choosing, a splendid
unnecessariness, a sense of wide margin, of freedom, of power, and no
need to think of putting away what was left over for next day.</p>

<p>So by the time that Carruthers said, with that simplicity which made his
mother sure there was no one in the world like her Gerry, ‘I’ve never
seen any one as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_111">{111}</a></span> beautiful as you, and I didn’t know there could be
anybody,’ Sally, unstiffened and lubricated by all the cream, was quite
ready to discuss her appearance or anything else with him as far as she,
restricted of speech as she was, could discuss at all, and he discovered
to his deep surprise that she regarded her beauty as a thing to be
apologised for, as a pity, as the same thing really as a deformity,
forcing her to be conspicuous and nothing but a worry to those she loved
and who loved her, and she not able to help it or alter it, or do
anything at all except be sorry.</p>

<p>‘Father,’ she said, ‘was in a state&mdash;you’ve no idea. If any one just
looked my way. And they was always lookin’.’</p>

<p>Carruthers nodded. Just what he had been thinking when first he saw her
on the hill behind St. Mawes, with Luke trying to cover her up, to
extinguish her quickly in her hat,&mdash;the responsibility, the anxiety....
But that she herself should regard it like that astonished him. Surely
any woman....</p>

<p>‘And Mr. Luke&mdash;<i>’e’s</i> frightened too. ‘Ides me, same as Father and
Mother used.’</p>

<p>‘You’re really imprisoned, then,’ said Carruthers, staring at her.
‘Imprisoned in your beauty.’</p>

<p>But seeing a puzzled expression come into her eyes he began to talk of
other things, to tell her stories, to amuse her; for after all it wasn’t
very fair to Luke, somehow, whose back happened to be turned, much
against his will Carruthers was sure, to let her tell him about herself
and her life. She was too defenceless. She was a child, who would talk
to any stranger who was kind; and he could guess all he was entitled to
know, he could see for himself the gift she held in her hands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_112">{112}</a></span> the
supreme gift for a woman, the gift beyond all others in power for the
brief time it lasted, and he could see she was entirely unconscious of
its value, of what might be done with it if only she knew how. And every
time she opened her touchingly beautiful mouth of quick smiles and
painstaking response, her h’s dropped about him in showers.</p>

<p>Well, who cared? She might say anything she liked, and it wouldn’t
matter; in any voice, with any accent, and it wouldn’t matter. Not even
if she said coy common things, or arch common things, as he half
expected she would when first she spoke and startled him with the
discovery of her class, would it matter, For one needn’t listen. One
could always just sit and watch. Yes&mdash;who cared?</p>

<p>But the answer to that, he knew, wasn’t simply Nobody, it was Jocelyn
Luke. Luke would care. He quite obviously did care already, though they
couldn’t have been married more than two or three weeks; and she dumbly
felt it, Carruthers was sure, for, after having been eager to get out of
her imprisoning shell of illiteracy and say what she could while she was
alone with him, directly Luke joined them she retired into a kind of
anxious caution, looking at him before she said anything in answer to a
question, and keeping as much as possible to Yes and No.</p>

<p>‘He’s been teaching her,’ thought Carruthers. ‘He’s been going for her
h’s. She’s on his nerves, and she knows it&mdash;no, not knows it, but feels
it. She doesn’t <i>know</i> anything about anything yet, but she feels a
jolly lot, I’ll swear.’</p>

<p>Deeply interesting Lukes. What would their fate be, he wondered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>After Carruthers had gone, pensively driving himself back to St. Mawes
in the pale spring twilight, Jocelyn, soothed by his agreeable talk and
manifest friendliness, and also by the good tea, felt quite different.
He no longer wanted to admonish Sally. He didn’t even want to ask her
why she had come out of the bedroom. He was ashamed of that; ashamed of
having locked her in, degrading her to God knew what level of
childishness, of slavery, of, indeed, some pet animal that might
stray&mdash;in fact, a dog. He shuddered a little, and looked at her
deprecatingly, and leaning over the table took her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>‘Sally,’ he murmured, suddenly for the first time since he grew up,
feeling very young,&mdash;and how painfully young to be married!</p>

<p>Marriage. It wasn’t just love-making, he thought as he kissed her hand;
love-making, and then done with it and get on with your work. It was
responsibility constant and lasting, not only for the other life so
queerly and suddenly and permanently joined on to one, but also for
oneself in a quite new way, a way one had never till then at all
considered.</p>

<p>He kissed her hand again.</p>

<p>‘Tea done ’im good,’ thought Sally.</p>

<p>But it was the half hour with one of his own kind, and one who, while
definitely charming to him, yet so obviously and with a kind of
reverence admired Sally, that had done him good. It had restored him to
a condition of tranquillity, and he felt more normal, more really
happy&mdash;he didn’t count his moments of wild rapture as happiness, because
they somehow weren’t&mdash;than he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">{114}</a></span> done since the days, now so curiously
far away, before he had met her. Carruthers had reassured him. His
behaviour to Sally had immensely reassured him. The world was, after
all, chiefly decent. It didn’t consist solely of foul-minded Cupps, nor
of impudent young men in garages. Just as there were more people in it
healthy than sick, so there were more people in it who were appreciative
and kindly than there were people who weren’t. Carruthers had known all
about him, too. Jocelyn hadn’t credited Oxford with so much intelligent
awareness. It was infinitely pleasant, after a fortnight with Sally who,
wonderful as she was, uniquely wonderful he freely admitted, yet hadn’t
the remotest idea of what he had done and still hoped to do&mdash;yes, by
God, still hoped to do. Why not? Why chuck Cambridge after all? Why not
face it with Sally, and train her who was, he knew, most obedient and
only needing showing, to behave in such a way that no one, if she lived
there, would dare make himself a nuisance?&mdash;it was infinitely pleasant
after this to have been with somebody who knew all about him. He hadn’t
got very far, of course, in his work; nobody knew that better than
himself. But it had been a good enough beginning for Carruthers and
Oxford to have heard of him. And the desire to go on, to proceed along
the glorious path, came back to him in a mighty flood as he sat in the
Thistle and Goat’s drawing-room, with that other desire appeased and
seeming to be getting ready to fall into its proper place.</p>

<p>If Sally too could be got into her proper place, mightn’t life even yet
be a triumph?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>He wrote to his mother that night, after Sally had gone to bed. He sent
her there early, and with a return of irritability, because of the way
the people in the dining-room at dinner, and afterwards in the
drawing-room where he and she sat in a remote corner while he had his
coffee, behaved. It was really outrageous. This was his first experience
of dining with her in a public place. And it was no good his glaring at
the creatures, because they never gave him so much as a glance.</p>

<p>So he sent her to bed, and then he wrote to his mother. Better go home.
Better now go home to South Winch, and not wander about in expensive
hotels, with hateful old men in dinner jackets and fat women in beads
staring their eyes out. Hotels were impossible with Sally; and so were
lodgings, with the risk of another suspicious and insulting landlady.
Besides, a fortnight was enough for a honeymoon, and for this particular
honeymoon, with all its difficulties, quite enough. Home was the place.
Almond Tree Cottage, and its quiet. He wanted to go home. He wanted to
go home to his mother, and get her meeting with Sally over, and sit in
that little study of his at the top of the house where not a soul could
see him, and think out what was best to do next.</p>

<p>His mother would help him. She had always understood and helped. Never
yet had she failed him. And she would help him, too, in the business of
looking after Sally,&mdash;take her off his hands sometimes, and perhaps
succeed in getting her quite soon to talk like a civilised being.</p>

<p>It had been the last thing he had originally intended,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_116">{116}</a></span> to go with Sally
to stay at his mother’s. Introduce her, of course; take her down for a
day; but not stay there, for well did he know his marriage would fall
like a sword on his mother, cleaving her heart. Things, however, had
changed since then. He had in his haste, in his blind passion, written
to her that he was going to chuck Cambridge, and now that his passion
was no longer blind and he wasn’t going to chuck it&mdash;no, he’d be damned
if he would; not anyhow till he had tried what it was like there with
Sally&mdash;he was anxious to go to his mother and heal up at least one of
the wounds he knew his letter must have made. He would ask her what she
thought, having seen Sally, of the idea of her living in Cambridge.
Perhaps&mdash;it flashed into his mind like light&mdash;his mother would live
there too; give up Almond Tree Cottage, and live with them in Cambridge.
What a solution. Then she could look after Sally, and be such a comfort,
such a blessed comfort, to him as well. What a splendid, simple
solution.</p>

<p>He threw down his pen, and stared straight in front of him. They would
all be happy then&mdash;he going on with his work, Sally being taught by his
mother, and his mother not separated from him.</p>

<p>When he went to bed, and Sally stirred in her sleep as if she were
waking up, he took her in his arms and asked her if she would like to
live in Cambridge.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ murmured Sally, even though half asleep remembering to stick to
monosyllables.</p>

<p>‘It’ll be better than London,’ said Jocelyn, holding her close. ‘Won’t
it, my love? Won’t it, my <i>beautiful</i> love?’ he added in a whisper, for
there was something about Sally’s hair, against which his face was, a
softness, a sweetness....<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_117">{117}</a></span></p>

<p>‘And perhaps my mother will come and live with us too there. You’d like
that, wouldn’t you, darling?’</p>

<p>There was a brief pause. Then, ‘Yes,’ murmured Sally.</p>

<p>He kissed her delicious hair. ‘Darling,’ he said tenderly, pleased by
this absence of all difficulty. ‘You’re half asleep,’ he added in her
ear, pushing aside the hair that lay over it with his mouth.</p>

<p>But was she? For, after another pause, she said, her face still turned
away from him, something that sounded like Father.</p>

<p>‘Yes, darling?’ said Jocelyn, as she didn’t go on.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>E might come too, p’raps,’ murmured Sally.</p>

<p>‘What?’ said Jocelyn, not sure he could have heard right, bending his
face nearer. ‘Your father?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ murmured Sally.</p>

<p>‘Your <i>father</i>?’ said Jocelyn again.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ murmured Sally. ‘Then&mdash;we’d be tidy like&mdash;you’d ’ave ’er, and I’d
’ave ’im.’</p>

<p>‘Go to sleep Sally,’ said Jocelyn with sudden authority. ‘Do you know
what time it is? Nearly eleven.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_118">{118}</a></span>’</p>

<h2><a id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, at Almond Tree Cottage, Jocelyn’s mother had become Margery
to Mr. Thorpe, and he to her was Edgar.</p>

<p>The idea she had played with, the possibility she had smiled at, was now
fact. She had reacted to Jocelyn’s marriage by getting involved,
immediately and profoundly, in Mr. Thorpe. Without quite knowing how,
with hardly a recollection of when, she had become engaged to him. He
had caught her at the one moment in which, blind with shock, she would
have clung to anything that offered support.</p>

<p>How could she face South Winch without support? For there was not only
her inward humiliation to be dealt with, the ruin of her love and pride
and the wreck of those bright ambitious dreams&mdash;surely of all ambitious
dreams the most natural and creditable, the dreams of a mother for the
future greatness of her son,&mdash;there was the pity of South Winch. No, she
couldn’t stand pity; and pity because of Jocelyn, of all people! Of him
who had been her second, more glorious self, of him who was to have been
all she would have been if she could have been. South Winch couldn’t
pity her if she married its richest man. There was something about
wealth, when present in sufficient quantities, that silenced even
culture;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_119">{119}</a></span> and everybody knew about Mr. Thorpe’s house, and grounds, and
cars, and conservatories. She therefore dropped like a fruit that no
longer has enough life to hold on, into the outstretched hands of Mr.
Thorpe.</p>

<p>Jocelyn didn’t want her; Mr. Thorpe did. It was a deplorable thing, she
thought, for she could still at intervals, in spite of her confusion and
distress, think intelligently, that a woman couldn’t be happy, couldn’t
be at peace, unless there existed somebody who wanted her, and wanted
her exclusively; but there it was. Deplorable indeed, for it now flung
her into Mr. Thorpe’s arms prematurely, without her having had time
properly to think it out. No doubt she would have got into them in the
end, but not yet, not for years and years. Now she tumbled in from a
sheer instinct of self-preservation. She had to hold on to some one. She
was giddy and staggering from the blow that had cut through her life.
Jocelyn, her boy, her wonderful, darling boy, in whose career she had so
passionately merged herself, doing everything, even the smallest thing,
only with reference to him, wanted her so little that he could throw her
aside, thrust her away without an instant’s hesitation, and with her his
whole future, the future he and she had been working at with utter
concentration for years, for the sake of a girl he had only known a
fortnight. He said so in the letter. He said it was only a fortnight.
One single fortnight, as against those twenty-two consecrated years.</p>

<p>Who was this girl, who was this person for whom he gave up everything at
a moment’s notice? Mrs. Luke, shuddering, hid in Mr. Thorpe’s arms; for
the things that Jocelyn hadn’t said in that letter on the eve of his
marriage were more terrible almost to her than those he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_120">{120}</a></span> had said,&mdash;the
ominous non-reference to the girl’s family, to her upbringing, to her
circumstances. Hardly had he mentioned her name. At the end, in a
postcript, as if in his heart he were ashamed, he had said it was
Salvatia&mdash;Salvatia!&mdash;and her father’s name was Pinner, but that he
really didn’t know that it mattered, and he wouldn’t have cared, and
neither would anybody else who saw her care, if she hadn’t had fifty
names. And then he had added the strange words, ominously defiant,
unnecessarily coarse, that he would have taken her, and so would any one
else who saw her, in her shift; and then still further, and still more
strangely and coarsely, he had scribbled in a shaky hand, as though he
had torn open the letter again and stuck it in in a kind of frenzy of
passion, ‘My God&mdash;her shift!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke hid in Mr. Thorpe’s arms. Coarseness had never yet got into
Almond Tree Cottage, except the coarseness consecrated by time, which it
was a sign of intelligence not to mind, the coarseness, for instance, of
those marvellous Elizabethans. But coarseness from Jocelyn? Oh, blind
and mad, blind and mad. Where had her boy got it from, this capacity for
sudden, violent, ruinous behaviour? Not from her, very certainly. It
must be some of the thick, sinister blood filtered down into him from
the Spanish woman her husband’s great-grandfather&mdash;Mrs. Luke had been
pleased with this great-grandfather up to then, because in her own
family, where there should have been four, there hadn’t been any&mdash;had
married against his parents’ wishes. She hid in Mr. Thorpe’s arms.
But&mdash;‘This in exchange for Jocelyn?’ she couldn’t help repeating to
herself that first day, trying to shut her eyes, spiritually as well as
physically, trying to withdraw her attention, as even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_121">{121}</a></span> this crisis
she remembered Dr. Johnson had done in unpleasant circumstances, from
Mr. Thorpe’s betrothal caresses.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe was clean and healthy; for that she was thankful. Still, she
suffered a good deal that first day. Then, imperceptibly, she got used
to him. Surprising how soon one gets used to a man, she thought, on whom
this one’s substantial shape had made a distinctly disagreeable
impression the first week she found herself up against it. By the end of
a week she no longer noticed the curious springy solidity of Mr.
Thorpe’s figure, which had seemed to her when he first embraced her,
used as she was to the lean fragility of her late husband, so
unpleasantly much. And besides, the flood of his riches began to flow
over her immediately, and it was a warm flood. She hadn’t known how
agreeable such a flood could be. She hadn’t had an idea of the way it
could bring comfort into one’s every corner&mdash;yes, even into one’s mind
when one’s mind was sore and unhappy. Riches, she had always held, were
vulgar; but she now obscurely recognised that they were only vulgar if
they were somebody else’s. One’s own&mdash;why, to what noble ends could not
riches be directed in the hands of those who refused to use them
vulgarly? Married to Mr. Thorpe, she would make of them as beautiful and
graceful a thing as she had made of her poverty. And it did soothe Mrs.
Luke, it did help her a great deal during these days of wreckage, that
her life, which had been so spare and bony, was now becoming hourly, in
every sort of pleasant way, more and more padded, more and more soft and
luscious with fat.</p>

<p>For, if no longer precious to Jocelyn, she was precious to Mr. Thorpe,
and it was his pride to pad out the meagre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">{122}</a></span>ness of her surroundings; and
though she cried herself to sleep each night because of Jocelyn, she
awoke each morning comforted because of Mr. Thorpe. After twelve hours
of not seeing Mr. Thorpe she could clearly perceive, what was less
evident at the end of a long evening with him, her immense good fortune
in having got him. A decent, honourable man. Not every woman in the
forties finds at the precise right moment a decent, honourable man, who
is also rich. Where would she have been now without Mr. Thorpe? He was
her rock, her refuge; he was the plaster to her wounded pride, the
restorer of her self-respect.</p>

<p>‘I can <i>rely</i> on him,’ she said to herself while she sat in front of her
glass in the morning, brushing her thick, black hair&mdash;in the evening
when she brushed it she didn’t say anything. ‘I can entirely <i>trust</i>
him. What, after all, is education? What has education done for Jocelyn?
The one thing that matters is character.’</p>

<p>And she would come down to find her breakfast-table strewn with fresh
evidences of Mr. Thorpe’s hot-houses and love.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Not a word from Jocelyn all this time, not a sign. He might be dead, she
thought; and it would have hurt her less if he had been. For dead he
would have been for ever hers; nobody then could touch him, take him
away. Crushed and bitter, she crept yet closer to Mr. Thorpe. He liked
it. He liked being crept close to. He was thoroughly pleased with what
in his business-like mind he referred to as his bargain.</p>

<p>She never mentioned Jocelyn to him, and he liked that too. ‘Young fool,’
he said, when he came round<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_123">{123}</a></span> unexpectedly early one evening, and found
her crying. ‘No use worrying about a fool.’</p>

<p>And Mrs. Luke, still further crushed by hearing Jocelyn called a fool,
and therefore being forced to the deduction that she had produced
one&mdash;yes, and it was true, too, in spite of his brains&mdash;could only hang
on to Mr. Thorpe, and say nothing.</p>

<p>He liked that. He liked to be hung on to, and he had no objection to a
certain amount of saying nothing in a woman. Her late husband, could he
now have seen her who was once his wife, would have been surprised, for
in his day she had never hung on, and had been particularly good at
conversation. But there was that about Mr. Thorpe which quenched
conversation. Even before her engagement, in the days of his preliminary
assiduities after his wife’s death, she had found it difficult, when he
came round, to keep what she understood was sometimes described as the
ball rolling; and she was completely in command of herself then, in the
full flood of her happiness and satisfaction. Conversation with him, the
kind she and South Winch knew and practised, was out of the question.
There was no exchange of opinions possible with Mr. Thorpe, because he
never exchanged his, he merely emitted them and stuck to them. And they
came out clothed in so very few words that they seemed to Mrs. Luke,
watching him with quizzical, amused eyes&mdash;ah, those detached days, when
one looked on and wasn’t involved!&mdash;almost indecently bare. Now she
drooped. She bowed her head.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe liked that. He liked a woman to bow her head. Gentleness in a
woman was what he liked: gentleness, and softness, and roundness.
Margery was gentle all right, and soft enough in places&mdash;anyhow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_124">{124}</a></span>
speech; but she wasn’t round. Not yet. Later, of course, after the cook
at Abergeldie&mdash;his house was called Abergeldie&mdash;had had a go at her, she
wouldn’t know herself again. And meanwhile, to put an immediate stop to
all this underfeeding, a stream of nourishment&mdash;oysters, lobsters,
plovers’ eggs, his own pineapples, his own forced strawberries, his own
butter and fresh eggs, and, once, a sucking pig&mdash;thickly flowed across
the daisied meadow dividing Abergeldie from Almond Tree Cottage.</p>

<p>The little maid turned yellow, and began to get up at night and be sick.
Mrs. Luke, feeling it was both wrong and grotesque to bury lobsters in
the back garden, and unable either to stop the stream or deal with it
herself, was forced to send most of the stuff round to her friends; and
so South Winch became aware of what had happened, for nobody except Mr.
Thorpe grew pineapples and bought plovers’ eggs, and nobody gave such
quantities of them to a woman without being going to marry her
afterwards.</p>

<p>Well, it was as good a way as any other of letting people know, thought
Mrs. Luke, sitting in silence with Mr. Thorpe’s arm round her waist,
while every now and then he furtively felt to see whether she wasn’t
beginning anywhere to curve. Instead of sending round <i>billets de faire
part</i> she sent lobsters. Rather original, she thought, with a slight
return to her detached and amused earlier self. ‘Does he really think I
can eat them all?’ she wondered.</p>

<p>And the little maid, in whose kitchen much, even so, remained, fell from
one bilious paroxysm into another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>She was warmly congratulated. It soothed her afresh, this new importance
with which she was instantly clothed. Money&mdash;she sighed, but faced
it&mdash;money, even in that place where people really did try to keep their
eyes well turned to the light, was a great, perhaps the greatest, power.
She sighed. It oughtn’t to be so; but if it was so? And who would not be
grateful, really deeply grateful, to Edgar, and put up with all his
little ways, when he was so generous, so kind, and so completely
devoted? Besides, his little ways would, she was sure, later on become
much modified. A wife could do so much. A well-bred, intelligent
wife&mdash;it was simply silly not to admit plain facts&mdash;could do everything.
When she was married....</p>

<p>And then she found herself shrinking from the thought of when she was
married. She could restrain his affection now; it was her privilege. But
when she was married, it would be his privilege not to be able to be
restrained. And there appeared to be no age limit to a man’s
affectionateness. Here was Edgar, well over sixty and still
affectionate. Really, really, thought Mrs. Luke, who even in her most
ardent days had loved only with her mind.</p>

<p>And then one evening, nearly three weeks after the arrival of that
letter of Jocelyn’s that had brought all this about, Mr. Thorpe said,
‘When’s it going to be?’</p>

<p>‘When is what going to be?’ she asked, starting.</p>

<p>To this he only replied, ‘Coy, eh?’ and sat staring at her proudly and
affectionately, a hand on each knee.</p>

<p>Pierced by the word, Mrs. Luke hastened to say in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_126">{126}</a></span> most level voice,
‘You mean our marriage? Surely there’s plenty of time.’</p>

<p>‘Time, eh? You bet there isn’t. Not for you and me. We’re no chickens,
either of us.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke winced. She had never at any time tried, or wished, or
pretended to be a chicken, yet to be told she wasn’t one was strangely
ruffling. If it were a question of chickens, compared with Edgar she
certainly was one. These things were relative. But what a way of....</p>

<p>And then, as before, the little maid came in with a letter, and Mr.
Thorpe, vexed as before by the interruption (why that servant&mdash;well, one
could hardly call a thing that size a servant; that aproned spot,
then&mdash;couldn’t leave letters outside till they were wanted ...), said,
curbing himself, ‘Letter, eh?’</p>

<p>‘From Jocelyn,’ said Mrs. Luke, who had flushed a bright flame-colour,
and whose hands, as they held the letter, were shaking.</p>

<p>‘Thought so,’ said Mr. Thorpe in disgust.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>He learned with profound disapproval that Jocelyn was bringing his bride
to Almond Tree Cottage. He didn’t want brides about&mdash;none, that is,
except his own; and he feared this precious son of hers, who had behaved
to her about as badly as a son could behave, would distract Margery’s
attention from her own affairs, and make her even more coy about fixing
the date of her wedding than she already was.</p>

<p>‘Going to sponge on you,’ was his comment.</p>

<p>She shrank from the word.</p>

<p>‘Jocelyn isn’t like that,’ she said quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Pooh,’ said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>She shrank from this word too. Edgar was, as she well knew and quite
accepted, a plain man and a rough diamond, but a man shouldn’t be too
plain, a diamond shouldn’t be too rough. Besides, surely the expression
was obsolete.</p>

<p>‘My dear Edgar,’ she protested gently.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe persisted. ‘It’s pooh all right,’ he said. ‘Young men with
wives in their shifts’&mdash;he remembered every word of that first
letter&mdash;‘and only five hundred a year to keep them on, always sponge. Or
try to,’ he said, instinctively closing his hands over his pockets. ‘Got
to live, you know. Must stay somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘He is going to live in London,’ said Mrs. Luke. ‘You remember he said
so in his first letter. Live there and do&mdash;do literary work.’</p>

<p>‘Bunkum,’ said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>And this word seemed to her even more obsolete, if possible, than pooh.</p>

<p>But there was no time to worry about words. What was she going to do?
Where was she going to put Jocelyn and his wife? How was she going to
receive them? Had she better pretend to South Winch that she had known
nothing about it till they had appeared on her doorstep and overwhelmed
her with the news? Had she better pretend that Jocelyn had given up
Cambridge because he had been offered a position in London too good to
refuse? Or had she better hide them indoors till they had found rooms in
London, and could be got away again without having been seen, and
meanwhile go on behaving as if nothing had happened?</p>

<p>She lost her head. Standing there, with the letter in her shaking hands
and Mr. Thorpe, who wouldn’t go<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_128">{128}</a></span> away, squarely in front of her, she
lost her practical, cool head, and simply couldn’t think what to do. One
thing alone was clear&mdash;she was going to suffer. And presently another
thing emerged into clearness, an absurd thing, but curiously difficult
and unpleasant,&mdash;she had no spare-room, and in Jocelyn’s room was only
the little camp bed it had pleased him (and her too, who liked to think
of him as Spartan), to sleep in. This was no house for more than just
herself and Jocelyn. Oh, why hadn’t she married Mr. Thorpe at once? Then
she would have been established at Abergeldie by now, and able to let
the pair have Almond Tree Cottage to themselves.</p>

<p>Abergeldie. The word brought light into her confusion. Of course. That
was where they must go. Abergeldie, majestic in the size and number of
its unused spare-rooms, magnificent in its conveniences, its baths, its
staff of servants. She had been taken over it, as was fitting; had waded
across the thickness of its carpets, admired its carved wardrobes,
marble-topped washstands and immense beds, gazed from its numerous
windows at its many views, wilted through its hot-houses, ached along
its lawns, and knew all about it. The very place. And, given courage by
the knowledge of the impossibility of housing more than one person
beside herself in her own house, urged on by the picture in her mind of
that tiny room upstairs and its narrow bed, she made her suggestion to
Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>Nervously she made it, fearing that the reason for it, fearing that the
merest most passing mention of such a thing as a bed, would bring out
the side of him which she was forced to recognise as ribald. And it did.
He said all the things she was so sorry to have been obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">{129}</a></span> to expect
he would. But he was good-natured; he liked to feel he was helping
Margery out of a fix. Also, the young fool would be away from his mother
then, and perhaps some sense could be got into his head, and at the same
time as sense was got in nonsense would be got out,&mdash;the nonsense, for
instance, of no doubt supposing that he, Edgar Thorpe, was the sort of
man who could be sponged upon beyond, say, a couple of days. Besides, he
was proud of Abergeldie, and hardly anybody, what with first Annie’s
being alive and then with her not being alive, had ever seen it.</p>

<p>So it was settled, and he went away earlier than usual to give his
orders to the housekeeper; and Mrs. Luke, creeping into bed with a
splitting headache, lay for hours staring at nothing, and trying to
forget Mr. Thorpe’s last words.</p>

<p>For, after he had most affectionately embraced her, so affectionately
that she was sure one of her tendons had snapped, he had said: ‘No good
his trying to milk <i>me</i>, you know.’</p>

<p>Milk him?</p>

<p>She lay staring into the dark. Was character, after all, better than
education?</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The Canon said it was, and so did his wife. In fact at tea next day in
Mrs. Luke’s little garden, on that bit of lawn round the cedar, near the
low fence across which grazed Mr. Thorpe’s Jersey cows, they all three
were unanimous that it was. Wonderful how daylight, ordinary things,
meals, tea-cups, callers, dispelled doubts.</p>

<p>‘Better to have both, of course,’ said the Canon, eating Mr. Thorpe’s
forced strawberries after covering<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_130">{130}</a></span> them with the cream that had been,
twenty-four hours earlier, inside those very cows, ‘but if that’s not
possible, give me character. It’s what <i>tells</i>. It’s the only thing that
in the long run <i>tells</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well&mdash;one isn’t seriously disputing it,’ said Mrs. Luke. ‘Only
these theories, if one presses them&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>She paused, and poured out more tea for Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p>‘For instance,’ she went on, ‘suppose a man had a cook of a completely
admirable nature. If he married her, could he be happy? I mean, an
educated man. Let us say a very <i>well</i> educated man.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, if she cooked nicely,’ said the Canon, who thought he
scented rather than saw the form of Mr. Thorpe lurking somewhere at the
back of his delightful parishioner’s remarks, and wasn’t going to be
caught.</p>

<p>He knew the importance of turning away seriousness, when it cropped up
at the wrong moment, with a laugh. A man as valuably rich as Mr. Thorpe
shouldn’t be taken too seriously, shouldn’t be examined and pulled
about. His texture simply wouldn’t stand it. He should be said grace
over, thought the Canon, who fully realised what a precious addition Mr.
Thorpe’s wealth in Mrs. Luke’s hands was going to be to South Winch, and
gobbled up thankfully. Gobbled up; not turned over first on the plate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke hadn’t invited the Walkers to tea. On the contrary, when first
they appeared at the back door, ushered through it by the little maid
who each time she saw the Canon’s gaiters was thrown by them into a
fresh convulsion of respectfulness, she had been annoyed. Because all
day long she had been vainly trying to collect and arrange her thoughts,
soothe her nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_131">{131}</a></span> prepare her mind for the evening, when Jocelyn had
said he would arrive&mdash;to supper, he wrote, somewhere round eight
o’clock,&mdash;and define what her attitude was going to be both to him and
to the girl with the utterly ridiculous Christian name; and not having
one bit succeeded, and impelled by some vague hope that out of doors she
might find quiet, that in Nature she might find tranquillity and
composure, had said she would have tea in the garden.</p>

<p><i>Nature never did betray the heart that loved her....</i></p>

<p>Some idea like that, though she wasn’t at all a Wordsworthian and
regarded him at best with indulgence, drove her out to what her corner
of South Winch held of Nature,&mdash;the bit of lawn, the cedar, the Kerria
japonica against the wall by the kitchen window, the meadow across the
railing, full of daisies and cows, and, on that fine spring afternoon of
swift shadows and sunshine, the wind, fresh and sweet with the scent of
young leaves.</p>

<p>But once the Walkers were there she found they did her good. They
distracted her. And they liked her so much. It was always pleasant and
restoring to be with people who liked one. The Canon made her feel she
was good-looking and important, and his wife made her feel she was
important. Also, they helped with the strawberries, from which, after a
fortnight of them at every meal, she had for some time turned away her
eyes. Later on, when she was alone again, there would still be at least
a couple of hours to decide in what sort of a way she would meet
Jocelyn; quite long enough, seeing how she couldn’t, whenever she
thought of the meeting, stop herself from trembling.</p>

<p>Oh, he had behaved outrageously to her&mdash;to her, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_132">{132}</a></span> mother, who had
given up her life to him. There had been men in past years she might
have married, men of her own age and class, by whom she might have had
other children and with whom she might have been happy all this time;
and she had turned them down, dismissed them ruthlessly because of
Jocelyn, because only Jocelyn, and his gifts and career, were to have
her love and devotion. Wasn’t it a shame, wasn’t it a shame to treat her
so? To behave to her as though she were his enemy, the kill-joy who
mustn’t be told and mustn’t be consulted, who must be kept in the dark,
shut out? And why, because he had gone mad about a girl, must he go
still more mad, and ruin himself by throwing up Cambridge?</p>

<p>A wave of fresh misery swept over her. ‘Go on talking&mdash;<i>please</i>,’ she
said quickly, when the Walkers, replete, fell momentarily silent.</p>

<p>They looked up surprised; and they were still more surprised when they
saw that her face, usually delicately pale, was quite red, and her eyes
full of tears.</p>

<p>The Canon was affectionately concerned, and his wife was concerned.</p>

<p>‘Are you not well, dear Mrs. Luke?’ she inquired.</p>

<p>‘My <i>dear</i> friend,’ said the Canon, setting down his cup, tidying his
mouth, and taking her hand. ‘My dear, <i>dear</i> friend&mdash;what is it?’</p>

<p>Then, impulsively, she told them. ‘It’s Jocelyn,’ she said. ‘He’s
married, and given up Cambridge.’</p>

<p>And all her mortification and bitter unhappiness engulfed her, and she
began helplessly to cry.</p>

<p>‘Dear, dear. Dear me. Dear, dear me,’ said the Canon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_133">{133}</a></span></p>
<p>‘Dear Mrs. Luke&mdash;&mdash;’ said his wife.</p>

<p>They sat impotently looking on. Such excessive weeping from the poised,
the unemotional, the serene Mrs. Luke, was most disconcerting. One
shouldn’t expose oneself like that, however unhappy one was, thought the
Canon’s wife, feeling terribly uncomfortable; and even the Canon had a
sensation he didn’t like, as of fig-leaves being wrenched off and flung
aside.</p>

<p>Well, having behaved like this&mdash;really her nerves had completely
gone&mdash;there was nothing left but to explain further, and after a few
painful moments of trying to gulp herself quiet she told them all about
it.</p>

<p>They were horrified. Jocelyn’s behaviour, to the Walkers who had
ripening sons of their own, seemed to the last degree disgraceful. That
the girl was some one to be ashamed of was very plain, or why should he
have come down voluntarily from Cambridge? Marriage by itself didn’t
stop a student from continuing there. He was ruined. He would never be
anything now. And as representing South Winch, which had not yet in its
history produced a distinguished man, the Canon felt this blighting of
its hopes that some day it would be celebrated as the early home of Sir
Jocelyn Luke, perhaps of Lord Luke&mdash;why not? hadn’t there been
Kelvin?&mdash;very keenly.</p>

<p>Poor mother. Poor, poor mother.</p>

<p>The Canon took her hand, and, raising it reverently to his lips, kissed
it. His wife didn’t mind this, because in sorrow, as in sickness, there
is no sex. Nobody enjoys kissing the hand of the sick. She minded
nothing the Canon did so long as he didn’t enjoy it.</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;and he’s bringing her here to-night,’ gasped Mrs. Luke, struggling
to keep down a fresh outburst.</p>

<p>‘Here? Bringing her here? Without first asking<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_134">{134}</a></span> your permission and
forgiveness?’ cried the Canon. ‘Disgraceful. Outrageous. Unpardonable.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>isn’t</i> it, <i>isn’t</i> it&mdash;&mdash;’ wept Mrs. Luke into her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Never, never could she forgive Jocelyn. No, she never, never would. Let
him manage for himself now. Let him lie as best he could on the
miserable bed he had made. She would tell him so plainly, and though she
couldn’t help his coming there that night she would insist that he
should go away again next morning and never, never come back....</p>

<p>And then, over the top of her handkerchief, she saw him standing there,
standing in the back-door looking at her: Jocelyn; the light of her
eyes; the only thing really in her life.</p>

<p>‘Jocelyn&mdash;oh, <i>Jocelyn</i>!’</p>

<p>She gave a kind of sobbing sigh; she struggled to her feet; she stood,
swaying a moment, holding on to the table; and then simply ran to him.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>‘Mother&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh&mdash;<i>Jocelyn</i>!’</p>

<p>He hugged her tighter than he had ever hugged her. He was raised quite
outside his ordinary self, in this joy of getting back to her. And that
she should run into his arms&mdash;she who never ran, who never showed
emotion!</p>

<p>‘You’re not angry, Mother?’ he asked, looking down at her upturned face,
still wet and red from her recent weeping.</p>

<p>‘Dreadfully,’ she said, smiling up at him, the strangest transfigured,
watery smile.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Mother&mdash;I knew you wouldn’t fail me!’ he cried, infinitely
relieved, infinitely melted and grateful.</p>

<p>‘Fail you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mother&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And they hugged again. His mother’s love was a miracle. Her voice was an
enchantment. Just to hear the words, the precious right words, said in
the precious right voice....</p>

<p>At the tea-table the Canon and his wife, who carefully didn’t look but
yet saw, were much shocked. This surely amounted to having duped them as
to her real feelings, to having got their sympathy and concern on false
pretences.</p>

<p>‘Hadn’t we better go home, John?’ Mrs. Walker inquired of her husband.</p>

<p>‘Much better,’ said the Canon, who didn’t see how to do it.</p>

<p>He looked about for a way of escape.</p>

<p>There wasn’t one, except by climbing over to the cows, and that would
involve them in trespass. Besides, retreat should be dignified.</p>

<p>‘But where&mdash;&mdash;?’ Mrs. Luke was whispering, her cheek against Jocelyn’s,
while with one hand she still clung hold of his neck. ‘Salvatia&mdash;&mdash;?’</p>

<p>‘In the sitting-room,’ whispered Jocelyn. ‘I put her there. I wanted to
see you first alone. Why on earth those Walkers are here to-day of all
days&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>He glanced at the scene on the lawn, where the Canon and his wife,
marooned at the untidy tea-table, were trying to seem absorbed in
something that wasn’t happening up above their heads in the branches of
the cedar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_136">{136}</a></span></p>
<p>‘You said supper-time&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘But I scorched to get to you quickly&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Then you wanted me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mother!’</p>

<p>And he hugged her again, and the Walkers looked about again for a way of
escape, and again found none.</p>

<p>Sweet, sweet, delicious beyond dreams, was this restoration to all, to
far more than all that had been apparent before, of her boy’s need of
her, and of his love. If this was the effect being married had on him,
then she was glad he had married. How could she be angry with a wife who
brought him closer than ever, more utterly than ever, back to his
mother? So, she thought, must the Prodigal Son’s father have felt about
the swine his boy had had such a dose of. He wouldn’t have resented
them; he must have quite liked them.</p>

<p>‘You’ll try and love her, won’t you, Mother?’ said Jocelyn. ‘She
is&mdash;very lovable.’</p>

<p>And taking his mother by the hand, he led her to the sitting-room.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>There stood the exquisite Sally; stood, because she was afraid to sit.
Round her slender body she held tightly the new wrap Jocelyn, among
other things, had bought her on their way through London and had
instructed her to keep on till he told her to take it off. It was grey,
so as to make her as invisible as possible, and was of the kind that has
neither sleeves nor fastenings; and Sally, who had never been inside a
thing like that before, clutched it with anxious obedience about her
with both hands.</p>

<p>Extravagantly slender in this garment, which took<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_137">{137}</a></span> on as if by magic the
most delicious folds directly it got hold of Sally, and too lovely to be
credible, she stood there, her lips parted in fright, and her eyes fixed
on the entering Mrs. Luke.</p>

<p>‘<i>Oh</i>&mdash;&mdash;’ said Mrs. Luke, catching her breath, who had read poetry,
who had heard music, who knew what April mornings in the woods are like,
when the sun shines through windflowers and the birds are wild with
young delight.</p>

<p>Sally’s knees shook. She clutched the grey wrap tighter still about her.
Mr. Luke’s mother was so terribly like Mr. Luke. Two of them. She hadn’t
bargained for two of them. And she was worse than he was, because she
was a lady. Gentlemen were difficult enough, but they did every now and
then cast themselves at one’s feet and make one feel one could do what
one liked for a bit, but a lady wouldn’t; a lady would always stay a
lady.</p>

<p>The word struck cold on Sally’s heart. What did one do with a lady? And
a lady, too, who seemed hardly older than her son, and as wide-awake and
sharp as you please, Sally was sure. She had been imagining Jocelyn’s
mother old and stout and whitehaired, and perhaps not able to see or
hear very well, and therefore comfortingly slow to mark what was done
amiss. And here was this thin, quick, almost young lady. No flies on
<i>her</i> for dead certain, thought Sally, clutching her wrap.</p>

<p>Her heart, which felt as if it had already sunk as far as it could go,
contrived to sink still farther. She stared at Mrs. Luke with the
fascinated fear of a rabbit confronted by a snake; but her stare, which
felt inside just as ugly and scared as that, was outside the most
beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">{138}</a></span> little look of gracious shyness, and Mrs. Luke, staring back,
was for a moment quite unable to speak.</p>

<p>Who was this? Had Jocelyn caught and married some marvellous daughter of
a patrician house? Had he been up to Olympus, and netted the young
Aphrodite as, on that morning of roses, she stepped ashore from her
shell?</p>

<p>She flushed scarlet. The perfect grace and youth, the dream-like
loveliness....</p>

<p>‘Why,’ she murmured under her breath, ‘how <i>beautiful</i>&mdash;&mdash;’ and took a
step forward, and held out both her hands.</p>

<p>‘Are you really my new daughter?’ she said in a low voice. ‘You?’</p>

<p>With a great effort Sally managed to stand her ground, and not shrink
away backwards before this alarming figure. She didn’t know what to do
about the held out hands, because if she let go of the wrap so as to
shake them it would fall off, and Jocelyn had said she was on no account
to let it do that.</p>

<p>She therefore stood motionless, and her tongue clove to the roof of her
mouth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke came close. ‘You wonderful child&mdash;<i>you’re</i> Salvatia?’ she
murmured.</p>

<p>With a great effort Sally continued to hold her ground; with a great
effort she unclove her tongue.</p>

<p>‘That’s right,’ she said, clutching her grey wrap.</p>

<p>Two words; but enough. How many times had not Jocelyn told her not to
say That’s right? But he had told her not to say nearly everything; she
couldn’t possibly remember all the things she wasn’t to say, however
hard she tried. Indeed, Sally in her flustered soul was thinking what a
mercy it was she hadn’t added<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">{139}</a></span> ‘mum.’ It had been on the tip of her
tongue, faced by a lady, and she had hung on to it just in time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke, startled, was arrested for an instant in her advance. Then,
not after all quite certain that she had heard what she had heard&mdash;it
seemed impossible that she should have&mdash;she went close up to Sally and
kissed her. She had to reach up to her for Sally was half a head the
taller, besides being rigid with fright.</p>

<p>‘Sally, kiss my mother and make friends,’ said Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mr. Luke&mdash;&mdash;’ said Sally, making a quick downward lunge of her
head.</p>

<p>‘Now, Sally&mdash;&mdash;<i>please</i>,’ protested Jocelyn. ‘She can’t,’ he added,
turning to his mother, ‘get used to calling me by my Christian name.’</p>

<p>‘Sorry,’ said Sally; and felt so very warm that she had a queer
conviction that even her stomach must be blushing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke stood looking at her, trying to smile. She now knew
everything. No need for words from Jocelyn, for explanations. She knew,
and she understood. Up to her to behave well; up to her to behave
wonderfully, and make him more than ever certain there was no one in the
whole world like his mother.</p>

<p>‘She’ll learn,’ she said, smiling as best she could. ‘Won’t
you&mdash;Salvatia?’</p>

<p>If only, thought Sally, she were back at Woodles; if only, only she were
back safe and quiet with her father at Woodles.</p>

<p>‘It was inevitable,’ said Mrs. Luke, turning to Jocelyn. ‘Absolutely
inevitable.’</p>

<p>He caught hold of his mother’s hands. That she should see that, that she
should instantly understand....<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>‘And I congratulate you with all my heart, my dear son, and my dear
daughter,’ Mrs. Luke went on, continuing to be wonderful. ‘You are both
my dear, my very dear, children.’</p>

<p>And Jocelyn bent his head over her hand, and kissed it in a fervour of
gratitude and relief.</p>

<p>And Sally, looking on at Usband in this new light, thought, ‘Well, I’m
blest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_141">{141}</a></span>’</p>

<h2><a id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Restored</span> by the shock both of Sally’s loveliness and language to her
normal self, Mrs. Luke’s tears dried up and her emotions calmed down,
and she began to think rapidly and clearly.</p>

<p>This situation had to be dealt with. The only person who could deal with
it with any hope at all of success was herself. She would, then, grasp
it firmly, as if it were a nettle, and wear it proudly, as if it were a
rose. Yes, that was the line to take: wear it proudly, as if it were a
rose.</p>

<p>More clearly than if Jocelyn had explained for an hour she saw what had
happened, what couldn’t have helped happening, once chance had shown him
Salvatia. From those few words of Sally’s she reconstructed the Pinner
family and its conditions, and as she stood gazing at her, with one hand
still in Jocelyn’s, she grouped the whole Pinner lot into the single
word Gutter. Jocelyn had found and picked up beauty in a gutter. The
gutter was as evident as the beauty, and as impossible to hide. Accept
it, then; accept it, and make South Winch accept it. Treat it as quaint,
as amusing, as completely excused by the beauty. She had made South
Winch accept Tiepolo, when it didn’t in the least want to, and now see
into what an enthusiasm it had lashed itself! Even so would she make it
accept<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_142">{142}</a></span> Salvatia; and ceaselessly every hour, every minute, she herself
would educate the girl, and train her patiently, and force her gently
into proper ways of speech and behaviour. Seventeen, was she? Mrs. Luke
felt that with seventeen all things were possible. A child. Wax. And she
was so really exquisite, so really perfect of form and colour and
movement, that it would be wonderful to watch her development, her
unfolding into at least the semblance of a lady.</p>

<p>Salvatia&mdash;‘No, no, dearest Jocelyn&mdash;not Sally, not Sally,’ she begged on
his calling her that, for she had a theory that names had the power of
making you be like them, and a Sally was foredoomed to unredeemable
vulgarity&mdash;should have masters (perhaps mistresses would be better,)
down from London, when once Mrs. Luke was married to Mr. Thorpe and
could afford things; regular teachers who would give her lessons at
stated hours, while she herself would give her lessons at all the
unstated ones. And she would take her everywhere, to each of the South
Winch festivities, whether tea-parties, or debates, or lectures, or
concerts or plays, and wherever she went Salvatia should be her open
glory. It would be a mistake in tactics, besides being an impossibility,
to try to hide her. She should be flaunted. For, confronted by a bull,
Mrs. Luke remembered, quite the best thing to do was to take it by the
horns.</p>

<p>So swiftly do thoughts gallop through minds like Mrs. Luke’s that she
had planned out her attitude in those few instants in the sitting-room,
while she stood gazing at Sally and holding Jocelyn’s hand.</p>

<p>‘We’re going to be <i>great</i> friends, are we not Salvatia?’ she said,
laying her free hand on her daughter-in-law’s delicate little shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>Great friends? She and the lady? The bare suggestion produced in Sally
that physical condition known to the Pinner family as fit to drop.</p>

<p>Directly questioned, however, she was forced to answer, so she said
faintly, ‘Right O,’ and Mrs. Luke, smiling elaborately and patting the
shoulder, said, ‘You very quaint little girl,’&mdash;and in spite of the
obvious inappropriateness of these adjectives as a description of the
noble young angel standing before her, she was determined that they
should, roughly, represent her attitude towards her.</p>

<p>‘Now we’ll all have tea,’ she said, suddenly becoming gaily
business-like. These children&mdash;it was she who must take them in hand. No
more emotions, she decided. Her beloved Jocelyn needed her help again,
couldn’t do without her.... ‘Won’t we, Jocelyn? Won’t we, Salvatia? I’ve
had some already, but I’ll be greedy and have some more. Jocelyn, you go
and tell Hammond&mdash;&mdash;’ Hammond was the little maid’s surname, and by it,
to her great astonishment who knew herself only as Lizz, she had been
called since she entered Mrs. Luke’s service&mdash;‘to make fresh tea and
bring it in here. You must both be dying for it. And then you can say
goodbye to the Walkers for me, Jocelyn, will you?’ she called after him.
‘Tell them I’ve got a most beautiful surprise for them&mdash;quite soon,
perhaps to-morrow. <i>You’re</i> the beautiful surprise, Salvatia,’ she said,
turning to Sally smilingly, who had made a sudden forward movement as if
to follow Jocelyn, and who, on seeing him go out of the room and leave
her alone with his mother, was so seriously alarmed that she again had a
queer conviction about her stomach, but this time that it was turning
what the Pinner family called as white as a sheet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Of course you know you’re beautiful, don’t you?’ said Mrs. Luke, busily
pulling out the little table the tea was to be put on in the absence of
the proper table in the garden, and clearing Sir Thomas Browne off it,
and also two bright tulips in a clear glass vessel. ‘You must have heard
that ever since you can remember.’</p>

<p>‘But I can’t <i>’elp</i> it,’ said Sally, very anxious, her eyes on the door.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Elp it? You quaint child. There’s an h in help, Salvatia dear. Help
it? But why should you want to? It’s a wonderful gift, and you should
thank God who gave it you, and use it entirely&mdash;&mdash;’ Mrs. Luke was quite
surprised at her own words, for she wasn’t at all religious, yet they
came out glibly, and she concluded they were subconsciously inspired by
the Canon in the garden&mdash;‘entirely to His glory.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, m&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘No&mdash;stop there, stop there,’ cried Mrs. Luke, quickly holding up her
hand and smiling. ‘You were going to say ma’am, were you not, Salvatia?
Well, you mustn’t. Not to me. Not to anybody. Except, of course,’ she
added, feeling she couldn’t begin too soon to help the child, ‘to the
Queen, and other royal ladies.’</p>

<p>And before her eyes floated that vision she had so often contemplated of
Sir Jocelyn Luke, of Lord Luke, and now was added to it Lady Luke, the
lovely Lady Luke, being presented at Court, and by that time as perfect
inside as out. Properly dealt with, Jocelyn’s marriage, instead of being
his ruin, might end by being one of his chief glories.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, little girl.’</p>

<p>Sally dropped as if she were shot on to the nearest chair, which was
Mrs. Luke’s.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Not there&mdash;not that one,’ said Mrs. Luke, smiling. ‘No, dear child&mdash;nor
that one,’ she added, as Sally having hastily got up again was about to
drop on to the next nearest one, which was Jocelyn’s&mdash;better get her
into all the little ways at once. ‘<i>Any</i> chair, Salvatia dear, except
just those two. Yes&mdash;that’s a very comfortable one. Is not it too
strange to think that this time yesterday you and I never had seen each
other, and had no more idea&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Sally, sitting down more cautiously on the edge of the third chair,
didn’t think that strange at all, but very natural and nice. There had
been lots of yesterdays without the lady in them, and all of them had
seemed quite natural. What really was strange was that they should have
left off and landed her here, shut up alone with somebody so happily
till then unknown. If only, thought Sally, she could now, having been
introduced and that, go somewhere where the lady wasn’t. For Mrs. Luke
terrified her more than any one she had yet in her brief life come
across. Worse, far worse, than her parents when, for her good, they used
to give her What for, and worse even than Mr. Luke when he turned and
just looked at her and didn’t say anything after she had passed some
remark, was this smiling lady who patted her. She couldn’t take her eyes
off Mrs. Luke, watching her with a fascinated apprehension, not knowing
where she mightn’t be going to be patted next.</p>

<p>Sitting sideways on the very edge of her chair, and still holding her
wrap tightly about her, Sally’s eyes followed Mrs. Luke’s slightest
movement. In any one else it would have been a stare, and Mrs. Luke
would have explained that she mustn’t, but there was nothing wrong to be
found with the look in Sally’s eyes,&mdash;nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_146">{146}</a></span> wrong, indeed, to be
found in anything she did, thought Mrs. Luke, arranging things
comfortably for everybody’s tea, so long as it wasn’t speaking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke knew she was being watched, but only, so it seemed, with a
lovely and gracious attentiveness. She also knew Sally was sitting on
the edge of her chair, with her legs drawn up under her just as if she
were trying to keep them out of something not quite nice; but no need to
disturb a position which somehow seemed sheer grace. What a pity, what a
pity, flashed across Mrs. Luke’s mind, that the child hadn’t happened to
be born dumb! Was that wicked? No, she didn’t think so. She herself
could imagine being very happy dumb, with plenty of books, and not
having to talk to bores.</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you like to take your hat off, Salvatia?’ she asked, drawing
Jocelyn’s chair closer to the little table.</p>

<p>Sally started. ‘No thank you, please&mdash;&mdash;’ she said hastily.</p>

<p>‘Do,’ said Mrs. Luke. ‘I want you to.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, m&mdash;yes, Mrs. Luke,’ said Sally, instantly obeying.</p>

<p>‘Not Mrs. Luke, dear&mdash;Mother. You must call me Moth&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Her voice died away, and she stood staring in silence. How wonderful.
How really amazingly beautiful. Like sunsets. And the girl, crowned with
that bright crown of waving light, like some royal child.</p>

<p>She stood staring, her hands dropped by her sides. ‘What a
<i>responsibility</i>,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘Pardon?’ said Sally, nervously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_147">{147}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The Walkers were got rid of, and Jocelyn came back frowning. They had
scolded him; him, who had been completely understood and unreproached by
his mother, the one person with either a right or a grievance. Having
known him since he was three didn’t excuse them, he considered; and it
seemed merely silly to rebuke him for leaving Cambridge when he wasn’t
going to leave it. He didn’t attempt to enlighten them; he just stood
and glowered, waiting till they should have done. What could old Walker
know of the way one was forced to react to beauty? He had probably never
set eyes on it in his life. And as for passionate love, the fiery love
that had been burning him up for the last few weeks, one had only to
look at Mrs. Walker to know he could never have felt that.</p>

<p>So he simply repeated, when the Canon paused a moment, that his mother
had asked him to say good-bye for her, and then, this second time, he
added, ‘She can’t come herself, because she is with my wife.’</p>

<p>‘Conceited young monkey,’ thought Mrs. Walker, who remembered him in
petticoats, and even then giving himself airs. ‘Wife, indeed.’ Both Mrs.
Walker’s sons were without gifts.</p>

<p>‘Your mother is an angel, sir,’ said the Canon sternly.</p>

<p>‘So is my wife,’ said Jocelyn, glowering.</p>

<p>‘No doubt, no doubt,’ said the Canon, who didn’t for a moment believe
it. Angels weren’t married in such a hurry. On the other hand, he was
sure young devils frequently were. They got hold of one and made one.
Jocelyn had been got hold of&mdash;lamentably, disastrously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">{148}</a></span></p>

<p>The Canon snatched up his hat. ‘Come along, Margaret,’ he said testily,
squaring his shoulders.</p>

<p>And Margaret came along, and together they marched off into the house,
along the passage, past the shut sitting-room door, accompanied by
Jocelyn who showed them out in silence.</p>

<p>He had said no word of that pleasant part of his mother’s message, that
part about having a beautiful surprise for the Walkers, perhaps
to-morrow, because he was annoyed with them, and they went away more
indignant with him than before, besides feeling they had been
treacherously treated by their hitherto dear friend, Mrs. Luke. And Mrs.
Walker, when they were safely out in the road, said what a very
disagreeable young man he had grown into, and the Canon said he hoped
Mr. Thorpe would lick him into shape, and Jocelyn, all unconscious of
Mr. Thorpe, went back frowning to his mother, who was in the act, when
he opened the door, of stroking Sally’s hair.</p>

<p>He forgot the tiresome Walkers, and his heart swelled with gratitude.
That Sally should be taken at once to his mother’s arms like this had
been outside his wildest hopes. Indeed, he had had no hopes, no clear
thoughts about it at all; he only, driven by weariness of the burden of
complications Sally brought into the simplest things, had come back to
his mother’s feet as the Christian sinner, tired of or frightened by his
sins, comes back to the feet of God. The analogy wasn’t perfect, of
course; Sally, so good and beautiful, couldn’t be compared to sin. But
he wanted to get back to his mother’s feet, he had a tremendous, almost
childish, longing to lie there and let her kick him if she chose. He had
treated her badly. He well knew he deserved it. Let her do<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_149">{149}</a></span> anything in
the way of rebuke and chastisement, if only he might lie there, he and
his burden, safely cast down, both of them, at her feet. ‘<i>I will arise
and go to my Mother</i>,’ had floated frequently through his head as he set
the bonnet of the Morris-Cowley eastward towards London and South Winch.
Naturally he hadn’t said it out loud. Sally was incapable of
understanding even a simple reaction. This one, which was highly
complicated, would have completely bewildered her. Besides, one can’t
well speak of a reaction to its cause.</p>

<p>But how happy was Jocelyn at the moment when he opened the door, and saw
her and his mother in that attitude of mutual affection; how deeply
relieved. The cords were loosened, the weight shifted. Here this calm
room, with everything in it just right, just <i>so</i>&mdash;its restraints, its
browns and ivories, its flashes of colour, its books, its one picture;
and upstairs, up under the roof, his own attic waiting for him, with its
promise of work to be resumed, to be carried on as it used to be in the
tranquil, fruitful days before he met Sally.</p>

<p>Jocelyn stood a moment looking at the scene, smiling his rare smile
because he was so content. How unlike the places he had suffered in
since he last was here. How unlike the Pinner lair at the back of the
shop, where he had burnt in torment, and the hideous dwelling of the
Cupps, where he had been insulted, and the dingy expensiveness of the
Thistle and Goat, and the other three or four cynically ugly and
uncomfortable rooms through which he had trailed his passion. Impossible
not to smile, not to laugh almost, with gladness at getting home again.
He had, he knew, all his life loved his mother, but it seemed as if he
hadn’t loved her consciously till now, and he went quickly across to her
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_150">{150}</a></span> put his arm about her, and said, ‘Mother, you must never leave me.
I can’t do without you. <i>We</i> can’t. When I go back to Cambridge&mdash;and of
course I’m going back&mdash;you must come too. You’re going to live with us
there. Everything depends on you. All my future, all my happiness&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And Sally, over whose head these words were being tossed, sitting very
rigid, for Mrs. Luke’s hand was still on her hair, and wholly
unaccustomed to displays of family affection, once again said to
herself, just for company’s sake and to keep her courage up, ‘Well, I’m
blest.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Mrs. Luke, however, was brought back by Jocelyn’s words to a vivid sense
of Mr. Thorpe. He had sunk aside in her mind during the emotions of the
last half hour. He now became distinct; extremely distinct, and
frightfully near. That very evening he would be coming round after
supper&mdash;he had agreed that the meal itself should be given over to
reunion&mdash;in order to collect his young guests.</p>

<p>Jocelyn, she knew, had no idea of his existence. Mr. Thorpe, though
living in South Winch, had not till then been of it. His world had been
different. His wealth had separated him, and his obvious
disharmony&mdash;South Winch had only to look at him to perceive it&mdash;with the
things of the spirit. Also, there had been his wife. So that if
mentioned, which was rarely, it had merely been with vague uninterest as
the rich man in the big house in Acacia Avenue.</p>

<p>Now he had to be mentioned, and Jocelyn’s words made it difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_151">{151}</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Luke stood silent, her hand still on Sally’s head, encircled by
Jocelyn’s arm, while he told her of the plans he had been making for the
last two days, ever since it suddenly dawned on him that that was to be
their future. How could she interrupt him with Mr. Thorpe? Yet Mr.
Thorpe was, she was sure, the real solution. Salvatia was going to be
expensive, very, if the gutter was to be properly scraped off her, and
no further stretching could possibly be got out of her own income, while
Jocelyn’s, of course, would be all needed for Cambridge. Yes&mdash;Mr.
Thorpe, who had begun by being a refuge, had now become a godsend.
Jocelyn would see it himself, when he had had him properly explained.</p>

<p>But how difficult to explain him&mdash;now, with the sweet balm of her boy’s
dependence on her and his love being poured into her ears, her boy, who
in his whole life hadn’t shown so much of either as he had in the half
hour since he came home. Yet it wasn’t her fault, it was Jocelyn’s. It
was his marriage that had precipitated Mr. Thorpe into their lives.
Still, she didn’t blame Jocelyn, for no young man, let alone her
imaginative, beauty-appreciating son, could have resisted Salvatia.</p>

<p>She stood silent, smiling nervously. To have to quench this happy
hopefulness with Mr. Thorpe was most painful. She smiled more and more
nervously. Apart from everything else, it embarrassed her, her coming
marriage, it embarrassed her dreadfully, somehow, faced by her grown-up
son. The memory of that almost snapped tendon last night ... suppose
Jocelyn were to think she was marrying Mr. Thorpe for anything but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_152">{152}</a></span>convenience, with anything but reluctance ... suppose he were to take
up a Hamlet-like attitude to her, and think&mdash;he would never, she knew,
say&mdash;rude things....</p>

<p>‘How delightful it all sounds,’ she said at last, removing her hand from
Sally’s head, who at once felt better. ‘Quite, quite delightful. But&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Now, Mother, there mustn’t be any buts,’ interrupted Jocelyn. ‘It’s all
settled.’ And rashly&mdash;but then he felt so happy and safe&mdash;he appealed to
Sally. ‘Isn’t it, Sally,’ he said. ‘We want Mother, don’t we. And we’re
going to have her, aren’t we.’</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;and Father,’ said Sally, whose ideas were simple but tenacious.</p>

<p>‘Father?’ repeated Mrs. Luke, touched. ‘Dear child, your poor Jocelyn
has no&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Mother, you and I must really have a good talk together,’ hastily
interposed Jocelyn, who saw Sally’s mouth opening again. She shouldn’t
<i>say</i> anything; she really shouldn’t <i>say</i> anything; the less she said
the better for everybody. ‘You and I. By ourselves. This evening, when
Sally&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Salvatia, Jocelyn. Please, please.’</p>

<p>‘&mdash;&mdash; has gone up to bed.’</p>

<p>‘But you know, Jocelyn dear,’ said Mrs. Luke, loosening herself from his
clasp and withdrawing a little, ‘that’s just what the dear child can’t
go up to. Not here. Not in this tiny house. You didn’t think, of course,
but there isn’t an inch of room really&mdash;not for three people. So I
wanted to tell you&mdash;’ she began putting his tie straight, her eyes on
it, not looking at him&mdash;‘what I’ve arranged. You’re both going to be
taken in next door.’</p>

<p>‘Next door, Mother?’ said Jocelyn, much surprised, for he couldn’t at
all recollect the next door people.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_153">{153}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, nearly next door,’ said Mrs. Luke, diligent over his tie, and
excessively annoyed to feel she was turning red. ‘At Abergeldie.’</p>

<p>‘Abergeldie?’ echoed Jocelyn, to whom the name was completely
unfamiliar.</p>

<p>‘I tell you what we’ll do,’ said Mrs. Luke, as though she had suddenly
had a brilliant idea, on the little maid’s appearing in the door bearing
a tray that seemed twice as big as she was, and all but dropping it when
she caught sight of the young lady on the chair. ‘After tea Salvatia
shall go and lie down in my bedroom and rest&mdash;won’t you, Salvatia,&mdash;and
you and I will have a quiet talk, dear Jocelyn&mdash;no, no, Hammond, not
there; here, where I’ve put the table ready&mdash;and I’ll tell you all
about&mdash;we want three cups, Hammond, not two&mdash;I’ll tell you all about&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But she still couldn’t bring herself to mention Mr. Thorpe, and again
said Abergeldie.</p>

<p>‘Is that lodgings?’ asked Jocelyn, who didn’t at all like the sound of
it.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no&mdash;it isn’t <i>lodgings</i>,’ said Mrs. Luke brightly, giving his tie a
final pat.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>How was she to tell him about Mr. Thorpe? In what words, once she had
got Salvatia upstairs out of the way, could she most quickly create in
Jocelyn’s mind the image she wished to have there of a good, and
honourable, and wealthy man, a man elderly and settled down, who
respected and esteemed her, and because he respected and esteemed her
wished to make her his wife? A good man, who would be a solid background
for them<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_154">{154}</a></span> all. A good man, whose feeling for her&mdash;Mrs. Luke was most
anxious that Jocelyn shouldn’t suppose there was anything warm about Mr.
Thorpe&mdash;was that of a kind, and much older, brother.</p>

<p>Preoccupied and perturbed, she poured out the tea and drank some
herself, and hardly noticed what Sally was doing who, faced for the
first time in her life by no table to sit up to and only her lap to put
her cup and saucer and spoon and things to eat on, kept on either
dropping them or spilling them.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mother, you’ll just have to be very patient,’ said Jocelyn,
himself deeply annoyed when Sally’s spoon fell off for the third time,
and for the third time made a noise on the varnished floor, which only
had two rugs on it, and those far apart.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Luke smiled, and said ‘Of course,’ and hardly noticed, because
of her deep preoccupation with Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>But when the cup itself slid sideways on the saucer and upset, and
Sally’s frock was soaked and the cup broken, she was startled into
awareness again, and for the moment forgot Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>my</i>!’ cried Sally, shaken into speech.</p>

<p>‘It really isn’t of the slightest consequence, Salvatia,’ said Mrs.
Luke, who was particularly fond of her teacups, of which none had ever
yet been broken. ‘Pray don’t try to pick up anything. Hammond will do
so. Jocelyn, ring the bell, will you? But I shouldn’t,’ she added, for
naturally she was vexed at the set being spoilt, and though breeding,
she knew, forbids vexation at such <i>contretemps</i> being shown, yet it has
to get out in some form or other, ‘I shouldn’t say, “Oh, <i>my</i>,” when
anything unexpected happens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_155">{155}</a></span>’</p>

<p>‘Right O,’ murmured Sally, shattered, all Jocelyn’s teaching vanishing
from her mind.</p>

<p>‘Nor,’ remarked Mrs. Luke, gently and very clearly, ‘should I say,
“Right O”.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve told her not to a hundred times,’ said Jocelyn, wiping Sally’s
frock with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘That’s right,’ murmured Sally, who had now lost her head, and only
wanted to admit her evil-doing and be forgiven.</p>

<p>‘Nor, dear Salvatia,’ said Mrs. Luke, still more gently and clearly,
‘should I, I think, say that.’</p>

<p>So then Sally said nothing, for there seemed nothing left to say.</p>

<p>‘She’ll be perfectly all right ultimately,’ said Mrs. Luke, coming down
to Jocelyn when presently she had taken her upstairs, and tucked her up
on the bed, and told her she was tired and must rest. ‘Perfectly.’</p>

<p>Jocelyn was waiting in the sitting-room. He and his mother were now,
having got Sally out of the way, going to have their talk.</p>

<p>‘You’re wonderful, Mother,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Darling Jocelyn,’ smiled his mother. ‘It’s that child who is
wonderful,’ she added. ‘Or will be, when she has been properly&mdash;&mdash;’ she
was going to say scraped, the word gutter coming once more into her
mind, but of course she didn’t, and substituted something milder. ‘When
she has been properly trained,’ finished Mrs. Luke.</p>

<p>‘It sounds like a servant,’ said Jocelyn, who was sensitive because of
the tin trunk (got rid of in Truro,) and the stiff nightgowns (got rid
of in Truro too,) and several other distinct and searing memories.</p>

<p>‘Servant? You absurd boy. She’s a duchess, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_156">{156}</a></span> happens not to have been
born right&mdash;the most beautiful duchess the world would ever have seen.
Now never,’ said Mrs. Luke with much seriousness&mdash;she felt she must take
this situation thoroughly in hand&mdash;‘never, never let such a word as the
one you just used enter your mind in connection with Salvatia again, my
dear Jocelyn.’</p>

<p>No, he wouldn’t tell his mother about the way Sally had seemed to drift,
as if drawn, towards the Cupps, quite obviously wanting to make friends
with them, nor about the way she actually had made friends with the
spotted mechanic in the Truro garage. And as for Mr. Pinner, for whom he
had a curious distaste and of whom the remembrance was definitely
grievous to him, Jocelyn wouldn’t tell his mother about him either. He
would skim over Mr. Pinner. Why intrude him? Why dot the i’s of Sally’s
beginnings? His mother had heard for herself how she spoke, and knew
approximately what her father must be like. Let her knowledge remain
approximate.</p>

<p>So they went together into the garden&mdash;again Mrs. Luke instinctively
sought Nature,&mdash;Jocelyn determined to keep Mr. Pinner out of his
mother’s consciousness, and Mrs. Luke determined to get Mr. Thorpe into
his.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Arm in arm they paced up and down what Mr. Thorpe persisted in calling
the drying ground, in spite of Mrs. Luke’s steady reference to it as the
lawn, and Jocelyn said, ‘Her family come from Islington.’</p>

<p>‘Suburbans. Like ourselves,’ replied his mother, with a really heavenly
tact, Jocelyn thought.</p>

<p>But she wasn’t thinking of what he was saying and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_157">{157}</a></span> what she was
answering; she was seeking a formula for Mr. Thorpe. And, to gain yet a
further moment’s grace,&mdash;queer how nervous she felt&mdash;she stopped a
moment in front of the Kerria japonica in the angle of the wall by the
kitchen window, and asked him if he didn’t think it was doing very well
that year.</p>

<p>‘Wonderful,’ said Jocelyn. ‘It’s all perfect.’</p>

<p>He sighed with contentment at his mother’s progressive and amazing
tactfulness. How had she not from the first moment grasped the
situation, and needed no explanation at all. Now she was grasping the
Pinners, and dismissing them without a single question. ‘Suburbans. Like
ourselves.’ At that moment Jocelyn positively adored his mother.</p>

<p>‘Quite perfect,’ he said, admiring the Kerria. ‘Wherever you are, things
grow as they should, and there’s peace, and order, and exact
<i>rightness</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Marriage has turned you into a flatterer,’ smiled Mrs. Luke, still
putting off Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘It has made me realise what a mother I’ve got,’ said Jocelyn, pressing
her arm.</p>

<p>‘Darling Jocelyn. But surely rather an unusual result?’</p>

<p>‘My marriage is unusual.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Luke, bracing herself. ‘Yes. I suppose&mdash;we had better
talk about it.’</p>

<p>‘But we <i>are</i> talking about it.’</p>

<p>‘I mean the future.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ve told you my plans.’</p>

<p>‘But I haven’t told you mine.’</p>

<p>‘Yours, Mother?’</p>

<p>He turned his head and looked at her. Surely she was rather red?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_158">{158}</a></span></p>

<p>‘You know, Jocelyn,’ she said, in a queer altered voice, ‘I was very
miserable. Very, very miserable. You mustn’t forget that. I really
<i>was</i>.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>How differently Mrs. Luke had meant to introduce Mr. Thorpe; how clearly
she recognised that in their present situation he was their only hope,
and that he should be explained with the appreciation and praise due to
an only hope. And here she was prefacing him by a solemn declaration of
her own unhappiness. It wasn’t at all the proper beginning. It couldn’t
but be damaging to Mr. Thorpe. Besides, her pride had always been to
appear before Jocelyn in every situation as completely content and calm.
Breeding, she had preached to him ever since he was a tot, was
invariably calm, and behaved very much like the great description of
charity in St. Paul’s first epistle to the Corinthians. Whatever it felt
it didn’t show it. But she had had a bad time lately, a bad, bad time,
and her nerves had been tried beyond, apparently, their endurance.</p>

<p>‘What is it, Mother?’ asked Jocelyn, surprised and troubled. Had his
mother been speculating, and lost?</p>

<p>She made a great effort to recover her self-control, and tried to smile.
‘Really some very good news,’ she said, resuming their walk. ‘We’ll go
and sit under the cedar, and I’ll&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Mother, what is it?’ asked Jocelyn again anxiously as she broke off, a
cold foreboding creeping round his heart. ‘You’re not going to&mdash;you’re
not going to fail me now?’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to help you more than I’ve ever done. In fact, if it hadn’t
been for this&mdash;’ she was going to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_159">{159}</a></span> windfall, but found she couldn’t
think of Mr. Thorpe as a windfall,&mdash;‘if it hadn’t been for this, I could
do very little for Salvatia. She will need&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Had his mother been speculating, and won?</p>

<p>But what Salvatia would need Mrs. Luke didn’t on that occasion explain,
for as on their way to the cedar they passed below the open window of
the bedroom Sally had been left in, they heard voices coming from it,
and Mrs. Luke, much astonished, stood still.</p>

<p>Almond Tree Cottage was a small low house, and its first floor windows
were not very far above the heads of those walking beneath them in the
garden. Standing there astonished&mdash;for who could Salvatia possibly be
talking to?&mdash;Mrs. Luke listened, her surprised eyes on Jocelyn’s face.
He too listened, but with less surprise, for from past experience he
could guess&mdash;it was painful to him&mdash;what was happening, and he guessed
that Sally was reverting to type again, and coalescing with the servant.</p>

<p>At first there was only a murmuring&mdash;one voice by itself, then another
voice by itself, then two voices together; and his mother’s face was
frankly bewildered. But presently Sally’s voice emerged, and it rose in
a distinct, surprising wail, and they heard it say, or rather cry, ‘Oh,
Ammond&mdash;oh, Ammond&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Twice. Just like that.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mrs. Luke let go suddenly of Jocelyn’s arm, and hurried
indoors and upstairs.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>‘Are you unwell, Salvatia?’ she asked quickly, opening the bedroom door.</p>

<p>On the edge of the bed, her stockinged feet trailing on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">{160}</a></span> the floor, sat
Sally, and beside her, also on the edge of the bed, the little maid.
Mrs. Luke couldn’t believe her eyes. Their arms were round each other.
She hadn’t realised, somehow, that Hammond had any arms; not the sort
that go round other people, not the sort that do anything except carry
trays and sweep floors.</p>

<p>It came upon her with an odd shock. If Salvatia were ill, of course
Hammond’s arms would be in an explainable and excusable position. But
Salvatia wasn’t ill. Mrs. Luke saw that at once. She wasn’t ill, for she
was crying; and people who are ill, she had observed, do not as a rule
cry.</p>

<p>The little maid jumped up, and stood, very red and scared, with alarmed
eyes fixed on her mistress. Sally did just the opposite&mdash;she lay down
quickly on the bed again, and pulled the counterpane up to her chin and
tried to look as if she hadn’t stirred from the position the lady had
tucked her into when she left her. What she was ashamed of was crying;
crying when everybody was so good to her and kind, patting and kissing
her and that, even after she had broken the cup. It was terribly
ungrateful of her to cry, thought Sally. But she wasn’t ashamed of
having put her arm round Ammond. Friendly, she was; friendly, and seemed
to know a lot for her age, which was six months less than Sally’s own. A
bit shy she had been and stand-offish at first, but soon got used to
Sally, who was feeling ever so lonely and strange, and when Ammond&mdash;of
all the names for a girl!&mdash;came in with hot water for the lady to wash
in before the next meal, Sally, taken by her friendly eye, began talking
to her, and it was as great a relief as talking to the young fellow in
the garage, only with the young fellow she had laughed, and with Ammond,
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_161">{161}</a></span> her confusion and shame, she did nothing but cry. But then the lady
... enough to make a cat cry, that lady ... going to live with them, and
never leave them any more ... keeping on smiling smiles that looked like
smiles, and weren’t....</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> know,’ said the little maid, nodding gravely.</p>

<p>Knew a lot, Ammond did, for her age.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Sally had been very thankful when that dreadful tea was somehow
finished&mdash;they had actually tried to make her have more tea, and begin
the cup and lap business all over again, but she wasn’t to be caught a
second time,&mdash;she had been very thankful to follow Mrs. Luke upstairs,
and let herself be laid out on a bed and told she must rest till supper.
Till breakfast next day she would rest if they liked, till kingdom come.
She didn’t want any supper. There were forks for supper, which were
worse than spoons, and perhaps they had that too just sitting round with
nothing but their laps. She didn’t want anything, not anything in the
world, except to be somewhere where the lady wasn’t. And the lady had
drawn the curtains, and then covered her up with a counterpane, and
smoothed back her hair, and told her sleep would refresh her, and bent
over her and kissed her, and at last had gone away&mdash;and how thankful
Sally had been, just to be alone.</p>

<p>Kissed her. In spite of the cup, thought Sally, who lay still as she had
been told, and reflected upon all that had been her lot that afternoon.
They didn’t seem able to stop kissing in that family, thought Sally, in
whose own there had been a total absence of what the Pinner circle knew
and condemned as pawings about. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_162">{162}</a></span> Pinners never pawed, nor did any of
their friends. Nice, that was, thought Sally wistfully; knew where you
were. Among these here Lukes&mdash;so ran her dejected thoughts, with no
intention of irreverence but unable, from her habit of language, to run
otherwise&mdash;one never could tell where one wasn’t going to be kissed
next. Hands, hair, face&mdash;nothing seemed to come amiss to them when they
once got going. Kept one on the hop; made one squirmy. And Mr.
Luke&mdash;<i>he</i> was different here. But then he kept on being different.
While as for that there lady&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this point of her meditations Sally had turned her face to the pillow
and buried it, and to her surprise she found the pillow was wet, and on
looking into this she discovered that it was her own tears making it
wet. Then she was ashamed. But being ashamed didn’t stop her crying;
once she had begun she seemed to get worse every minute. And the little
maid, coming in with the hot water, had found her crying quite hard.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Mrs. Luke made short work of the little maid. She merely said, in that
gentle voice before which all servants went down flat as ninepins,
‘Hammond, I am surprised at your disturbing Mrs. Jocelyn’s sleep&mdash;’ and
the little maid, very red and with downcast eyes, sidled deprecatingly
out of the room.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Luke took Sally in hand, sitting in her turn on the edge of
the bed.</p>

<p>‘Salvatia, dear&mdash;’ she said, laying her hand on the arm outlined beneath
the counterpane, and addressing the averted face. ‘Salvatia, dear&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Sally’s tears dried up instantly, for she was much too<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_163">{163}</a></span> much afraid to
cry, but she buried her face still deeper, and kept her eyes tight shut.</p>

<p>‘Don’t make confidences to a servant, dear child,’ said Mrs. Luke
gently. ‘Come to Jocelyn, or to me. We’re the <i>natural</i> ones for you to
come to in any of your little troubles. Oh, I know honeymoons are trying
for a girl, and often, without knowing why, she wants a good cry. Isn’t
it so, Salvatia? Then come to me, or to your husband, when you feel like
that, but don’t say things to Hammond you may afterwards regret. You
see, Salvatia dear, you’re a lady, aren’t you&mdash;a grown-up married lady
now, and your place is with your husband and me. What, dear child? What
did you say?’</p>

<p>Sally, however, hadn’t said anything; she had only gulped, trying to
choke down her misgivings at this picture of where her place was. With
the lady? ‘Shouldn’t be surprised,’ she thought, in great discomfort of
mind as she more and more perceived that her marriage was going to
include Mrs. Luke, ‘if I ain’t bitten off more as I can chew&mdash;&mdash;’ and
immediately was shocked at herself for having thought it. Manners were
manners. They had to be inside one, as well as out. No good saying
Excuse me, Pardon, and Sorry, if inside you were thinking rude. God saw.
God knew. And if you were only polite with your lips, and it wasn’t
going right through you, you were being, as she remembered from her
father’s teaching, a whited sepulchre.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Luke, contemplating the <i>profil perdu</i> on the pillow, the tip
of the little ear, the lovely curve of the flushed cheek, and the tangle
of bright hair, bent down and kissed it with a view to comfort and
encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_164">{164}</a></span> and Sally, trying not to shrink farther into the pillow,
said to herself, ‘At it again.’</p>

<p>‘Why did you cry, Salvatia?’ asked Mrs. Luke, gently.</p>

<p>‘Dunno,’ murmured Sally, withdrawing into the furthermost corner of her
shell.</p>

<p>‘Then, dear, it was simply childish, wasn’t it&mdash;to cry without a reason,
and to cry before a servant too. Things like that lower one’s dignity,
Salvatia. And you haven’t only your own dignity to consider now, but
Jocelyn’s, your husband’s.’</p>

<p>‘Oh dear,’ sighed Sally to herself, recognising from the tone, through
all its gentleness, that she was being given What for&mdash;a new kind, and
one which it was extremely difficult to follow and understand, however
painstakingly she listened. Which parts, for instance, of herself and
Mr. Luke were their dignities? ‘Good job I ain’t a nursin’ mother,’ she
thought, for she knew all about nursing mothers, ‘or the lady’d turn my
milk sour’&mdash;and immediately was much shocked at herself for having
thought it. Manners were manners. They had to be inside one, as well as
out. ‘Never think what you wouldn’t say,’ had been her father’s
teaching; and fancy saying what she had just thought!</p>

<p>‘<i>Oh Gawd</i>,’ silently prayed Sally, who had been made to repeat a
collect every Sunday to Mr. Pinner, and in whose mind bits had stuck,
‘<i>send down the ’Oly Spirit and cleanse the thoughts of my ’eart with
’im forasmuch as without thee I ain’t able to....</i>’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, dear,’ said Mrs. Luke, finding it difficult in the face of
Sally’s silence to go on&mdash;not for want of things to say, for there were
so many and all so important that she hardly knew where to begin,&mdash;‘the
best thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_165">{165}</a></span> you can do is to bathe your eyes in the nice hot water
Hammond has put ready, and tidy yourself a little, and then come
downstairs. What do you think of that? Isn’t it a good idea? It is dull
for you up here alone. But bathe your eyes well. We don’t want Jocelyn
to see we’ve been crying, do we, dear child&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And in the act of stooping to give Sally a parting kiss she heard her
name being called, loud and cheerily, downstairs in the hall.</p>

<p>She started to her feet.</p>

<p>‘Margery! Margery!’ called the voice, with the cheerful insistence of
one who, being betrothed, has the right to be cheerful and insistent in
his fiancée’s hall.</p>

<p>Edgar. Come hours before his time.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>‘Oh, hush, <i>hush</i>&mdash;&mdash;’ besought Mrs. Luke, hurrying down to him.</p>

<p>‘Hush, eh?’</p>

<p>‘Jocelyn&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>She glanced fearfully along the passage to the backdoor.</p>

<p>‘He’s arrived,’ said Mr. Thorpe, not hushing at all. ‘Know that. Saw
his&mdash;well, you can hardly call it a car, can you&mdash;his contraption,
outside the gate.’</p>

<p>‘But I haven’t had time yet to tell him&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘That he’s been a fool?’ interrupted Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘Come in here,’ said Mrs. Luke, taking him by the arm and pressing him
into the parlour, the door of which she shut.</p>

<p>‘Brought you this,’ said Mr. Thorpe, holding up a fish-basket, a big
one, in front of her face. ‘Salmon. Prime cut. Thought it would be a bit
of something<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_166">{166}</a></span> worth eating for your&mdash;well, you don’t have dinner, do
you&mdash;meal, then, to-night. Came back early from the City on purpose to
get it here soon enough.’</p>

<p>‘How kind, how kind,’ murmured Mrs. Luke distractedly.</p>

<p>‘Plenty of it, too,’ said Mr. Thorpe, slapping the basket.</p>

<p>‘Too much, too much,’ murmured Mrs. Luke, not quite sure whether it were
the salmon she was talking about.</p>

<p>‘Too much? Not a bit of it,’ said Mr. Thorpe. ‘I hate skimp.’</p>

<p>And he was going to put down his present on the nearest chair and then,
she knew, fold her in one of those strong hugs that scrunched, when she
bent forward and hastily took the basket from him. She couldn’t, she
simply couldn’t, on this occasion be folded&mdash;not with Jocelyn sitting
out there, all unsuspecting, under the cedar.</p>

<p>‘Never mind the basket,’ said Mr. Thorpe, who felt he had deserved well
of Margery in this matter of the fish.</p>

<p>‘I must take it to the kitchen at once,’ said Mrs. Luke, evading his
wide-opened arms, ‘or it won’t be ready in time for supper.’</p>

<p>‘What? No thanks, eh?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes&mdash;afterwards,’ said Mrs. Luke, slipping away to the door.
‘Jocelyn doesn’t know yet. About us, I mean. I haven’t had time&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Time, eh? Not had time to tell him, you’ve netted me?’</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe took out his watch. ‘Five minutes,’ he said. ‘Two would be
enough, but I’ll give you five.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_167">{167}</a></span> Trot along now, and come back to me
sharp in five minutes. If you don’t, I’ll fetch you. Trot along.’</p>

<p>Trot along....</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke, shutting him into the parlour, asked herself, as she went
down the passage bearing the heavy basket in both her delicate hands,
how long it would take after marriage to weed out Mr. Thorpe’s language.
To be told to trot along, however, was so grotesque&mdash;she to trot, she,
surely the most dignified of South Winch’s ladies!&mdash;that it seemed to
restore her composure. She would not trot. Nor would she, in the
emotional sphere, do anything that corresponded to it. She would neither
trot nor hurry; neither physically, nor spiritually. She declined to be
bound by five minutes, and a watch in Edgar’s hand. Really he must,
somehow, come up more to her level, and not be so comfortably certain
that she was coming down to his. And what a way to speak of their
marriage&mdash;that she had netted him!</p>

<p>Frozen, then, once more into calm by Mr. Thorpe’s words, she proceeded
down the passage with almost more than her usual dignity, and as she
passed the kitchen door she held out the fish-basket to the little maid,
who came out of the shady corner where the sink was with reluctance,
merely saying, ‘Boil it.’ Then, with her head held high as the heads of
those are held who face the inevitable, she went out into the garden,
and crossed the grass to where Jocelyn was waiting for her on the seat
beneath the cedar.</p>

<p>This took her one minute out of the five. In another four Mr. Thorpe
would come out too into the garden, to see why she didn’t return. Let
him, thought Mrs. Luke, filled with the courage of the cornered. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_168">{168}</a></span>
thing couldn’t be done in five minutes; it couldn’t be fired off at
Jocelyn’s head like a pistol. Foolish Edgar.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>‘Well, Mother?’ said Jocelyn, getting up as she approached.</p>

<p>He had been smoking, content to leave whatever it was Sally had been
doing in his mother’s capable hands, yet wishing to goodness Sally
hadn’t done it. This trick of wanting to be with servants must revolt
his mother. It revolted him; how much more, then, his fastidious mother.</p>

<p>‘I can guess what it is, I’m afraid,’ he said, as she sat down beside
him.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Mrs. Luke. ‘You haven’t any idea.’</p>

<p>‘<i>What</i> has she been doing, Mother?’ he asked, seriously alarmed, and
throwing away his cigarette.</p>

<p>‘Salvatia? Nothing. Nothing that matters, poor dear child. It’s not
about her I want to talk. It’s about Mr. Thorpe.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Thorpe?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Abergeldie. That’s Mr. Thorpe’s. That’s why you are going
there&mdash;because it is Mr. Thorpe’s.’</p>

<p>‘But why should we&mdash;&mdash;?’</p>

<p>‘Now Jocelyn,’ she interrupted, ‘please keep well in mind that Mr.
Thorpe is the most absolutely reliable, trustworthy, excellent, devoted
man. I can find no flaw in his character. He is generous to a
fault&mdash;really to a fault. He has a perfect genius for kindness. Indeed,
I can’t tell you how highly I think of him.’</p>

<p>Jocelyn’s heart went cold and heavy with foreboding.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mother. And?’ he said, after a minute.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_169">{169}</a></span></p>

<p>‘And he is rich. Very.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mother. And?’ said Jocelyn, as she paused.</p>

<p>‘When I got your first letter I was, of course, very much upset,’ said
Mrs. Luke, looking straight in front of her.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mother. And?’ said Jocelyn, for she paused again.</p>

<p>‘Everything seemed to go to pieces&mdash;all I had believed in and hoped
for.’</p>

<p>There was a longer pause.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mother. And?’ said Jocelyn at last, keeping his voice as level as
possible.</p>

<p>‘I’m not a religious woman, as you know. I hadn’t got God.’</p>

<p>‘No, Mother. So?’</p>

<p>‘So I&mdash;I turned to Mr. Thorpe.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mother. Quite.’</p>

<p>The bitterness of Jocelyn’s soul was complete. A black fog of anger,
jealousy, wounded trust, hurt pride and cruellest disappointment
engulfed him.</p>

<p>‘Why not say at once,’ he said, lighting another cigarette with hands he
was grimly determined should be perfectly steady, ‘that you are going to
marry him?’</p>

<p>‘If it hadn’t been for your marriage it never would have happened,’ said
Mrs. Luke.</p>

<p>‘Quite,’ said Jocelyn, very bitter, pitching the newly-lit cigarette
away. ‘Oh, quite.’</p>

<p>Sally again. Always, at the bottom of everything, Sally.</p>

<p>Then he thought, ashamed, ‘My God, I’m a mean cur’&mdash;and sat in silence,
his head in his hands, not looking up at all, while his mother did her
best to make him see Mr. Thorpe as she wanted him to be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<p>In her low voice, the low, educated voice Jocelyn had so much loved, she
explained Mr. Thorpe and his advantages, determined that at this
important, this vital moment she would not allow herself to be vexed by
anything Jocelyn said.</p>

<p>He, however, said nothing. It simply was too awful for speech&mdash;his
mother, who never during his whole life had shown signs of wanting to
marry, going now, now that she was at an age when she might surely, in
Jocelyn’s twenty-two year old vision, be regarded as immune, to give
herself to a complete stranger, and leave him, her son who needed her,
God knew, more than ever before, to his fate. That he should hate this
Thorpe with a violent hatred seemed natural. Who cared for his damned
money? Why should Sally&mdash;his mother kept on harping on that&mdash;be going to
be expensive? As if money, much money, according to what his mother was
saying, now that Sally had come on the scene, Sally who was used to
being penniless, was indispensable. Masters? What need was there for
masters? His mother could teach her. Clothes? Why, whatever she put on
seemed to catch beauty from her&mdash;he had seen that in the shop in London
where he bought the wrap: every blessed thing the women tried on her,
however unattractive to begin with, the minute it touched her body
became part of beauty. And how revolting, anyhow&mdash;marriage. Oh, how he
hated the thought of it, how he wanted now beyond anything in the world
to be away from its footling worries and complications, away from women
altogether, and back at Cambridge, back in a laboratory, absorbed once
more in the great tranquil splendours of research!</p>

<p>‘He is in the sitting-room,’ said Mrs. Luke, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_171">{171}</a></span> she had said
everything she could think of that she wished Jocelyn to suppose was
true.</p>

<p>‘Who is?’ said Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘Ah, I was afraid you would be angry,’ she said, putting her hand on his
arm, ‘but I hoped that when it was all explained you would understand,
and see the great, the immense advantages. Apparently you don’t, or&mdash;&mdash;’
she sighed&mdash;‘won’t. Then I must be patient till you do, or will. But
Mr. Thorpe is waiting.’</p>

<p>‘Who cares?’ inquired Jocelyn, his head in his hands; and it suddenly
struck Mrs. Luke that Mr. Thorpe was waiting very quietly. The five
minutes must have been up long ago; she must have been sitting there
quite twenty, and yet he hadn’t come after her as he had threatened.
Knowing him, as she did, for a man absolutely of his word, this struck
her as odd.</p>

<p>‘Dear Jocelyn,’ she said, remembering the fits of dark obstinacy that
had at times seized her boy in his childhood, and out of which he had
only been got by the utmost patience and gentleness, ‘I won’t bother you
to come in now and see Mr. Thorpe. But as he is going to be your host
to-night&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘He isn’t,’ said Jocelyn, his head still in his hands, and his eyes
still fixed on the grass at his feet.</p>

<p>‘But, <i>dearest</i> boy&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I decline to go near him.’</p>

<p>‘But there’s <i>positively</i> no room here for you both&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘There’s London, and hotels, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Jocelyn!’</p>

<p>She looked at him in dismay. He didn’t move. She again put her hand on
his arm. He took no notice. And aware, from past experiences, that for
the next two hours at least he would probably be completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_172">{172}</a></span>
inaccessible to reason, she got up with a sigh and left him.</p>

<p>Well, she had told him; she had done what she had to do. She would now
go back to Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>And she did go back; and opening the parlour door slowly and gently, for
she was absorbed in painful thought, she found Mr. Thorpe sitting on the
sofa, busily kissing Sally.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_173">{173}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="X"></a>X</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> following brief dialogue had taken place between him and Sally,
before he began to kiss:</p>

<p>‘Crikey!’ he exclaimed, on her appearing suddenly in the doorway.</p>

<p>‘Pardon?’ said she, hesitating, and astonished to find a strange old
gentleman where she had thought to find the Lukes.</p>

<p>‘It’s crikey all right,’ he said, staring. ‘Know who I am?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Sir, eh?’</p>

<p>He took a step forward and shut the door.</p>

<p>‘Father&mdash;that’s who I am. Yours. Father-in-law. Same thing as father,
only better,’ said he. ‘What does one do to a father, eh? Kisses him.
How do, daughter. Kiss me.’</p>

<p>Sally kissed him; or rather, having no reason to doubt that the old
gentleman was what he said he was, docilely submitted while he kissed
her, regarding his behaviour as merely another example of the inability
of all Lukes to keep off pawings; and though she was mildly surprised at
the gusto with which this one gave himself up to them, she was pleased
to notice his happy face. If only everybody would be happy she would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_174">{174}</a></span>n’t
mind anything. She hadn’t felt that the lady’s kisses were expressions
of happiness, and Mr. Luke’s, when he started, made her think of a
funeral that had got the bit between its teeth and couldn’t stop running
away, more than of anything happy. Father-in-law, on the contrary,
seemed as jolly as a sand-boy. And anyhow it was better than having to
talk.</p>

<p>This was the way the situation arose in which Mrs. Luke found them.</p>

<p>‘Making friends with my new daughter,’ said Mr. Thorpe, not without
confusion, on perceiving her standing looking on.</p>

<p>‘Quite,’ said Mrs. Luke, who sometimes talked like Jocelyn.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Now to have caught Mr. Thorpe kissing somebody else&mdash;she didn’t like it
when he kissed her, but she discovered she liked it still less when it
was somebody else&mdash;was painful to Mrs. Luke. Every aspect of it was
painful. The very word <i>caught</i> was an unpleasant one; and she felt that
to be placed in a position in life in which she might be liable to catch
would be most disagreeable. What she saw put everything else for the
moment out of her head. Edgar must certainly be told that he couldn’t
behave like this. No marriage could stand it. If a woman couldn’t trust
her husband not to humiliate her, whom could she trust? And to behave
like this to Salvatia, of all people! Salvatia, who was to live with
them at Abergeldie during term time, while Jocelyn pursued his career
undisturbed at Cambridge&mdash;this had been another of Mrs. Luke’s swift
decisions,&mdash;live with them, and be given advantages, and be trained to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_175">{175}</a></span>
become a fit wife for him,&mdash;how could any of these plans be realised if
Edgar’s tendency to kiss, of which Mrs. Luke had only been too well
aware, but which she had supposed was concentrated entirely on herself,
included also Salvatia?</p>

<p>And if the situation was disagreeable to Mrs. Luke, it was very nearly
as disagreeable to Mr. Thorpe. He didn’t like it one little bit. He knew
quite well that there had been gusto in his embrace, and that Margery
must have seen it. ‘Damn these women,’ he thought, unfairly.</p>

<p>The only person without disagreeable sensations was Sally, who,
unconscious of anything but dutiful behaviour, was standing wiping her
face with a big, honest-looking handkerchief, observing while she did so
that she wasn’t half hot.</p>

<p>‘Jocelyn is in the garden, Salvatia,’ said Mrs. Luke.</p>

<p>Regarding this as mere news, imparted she knew not to what end, Sally
could think of nothing to say back, though it was evident from the
lady’s eyes that she was expected to make some sort of a reply. She
searched, therefore, in her <i>répertoire</i>, and after a moment said,
‘Fancy that,’ and went on wiping her face.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you go to him?’ then said Mrs. Luke, speaking very distinctly.</p>

<p>‘Right O,’ said Sally, hastily then, for the lady’s eyebrows had
suddenly become rather frightening; and, stuffing the handkerchief yard
by yard into her pocket as she went, she exquisitely slid away.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be off too,’ said Mr. Thorpe briskly, who for the first time
didn’t feel at home with Margery. ‘Back on the tick of ten to fetch ’em
both&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but please&mdash;wait just one moment,’ said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_176">{176}</a></span> Luke, raising her
hand as he began to move towards the door.</p>

<p>‘Got to have my wigging first, eh?’ he said, pausing and squaring his
shoulders to meet it.</p>

<p>‘What is a wigging, Edgar?’ inquired Mrs. Luke gently, opening her clear
grey eyes slightly wider.</p>

<p>‘Oh Lord, Margery, cut the highbrow cackle,’ said Mr. Thorpe. ‘Why
shouldn’t I kiss the girl? She’s my daughter-in-law. Or will be soon.’</p>

<p>‘Really, Edgar, it would be very strange if you didn’t wish to kiss
her,’ said Mrs. Luke, still with gentleness. ‘Anybody would wish to.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Mr. Thorpe sulkily; for not only didn’t he see what
Margery was driving at, but for the first time he didn’t think her
particularly good-looking. Moth-eaten, thought Mr. Thorpe, eyeing her. A
lady, of course, and all that; but having to sleep later on with a
moth-eaten lady wouldn’t, it suddenly struck him, be much fun. ‘Need a
pitch dark night to turn <i>her</i> into a handsome woman,’ he thought
indelicately; but then he was angry, because he had been discovered
doing wrong.</p>

<p>‘I wanted to tell you,’ said Mrs. Luke, ignoring for the moment what she
had just witnessed, ‘that I have told Jocelyn.’</p>

<p>And Mr. Thorpe was so much relieved to find she wasn’t pursuing the
kissing business further that he thought, ‘Not a bad old girl, Marge&mdash;’
in his thoughts he called her Marge, though not to her face because she
didn’t like it&mdash;‘not a bad old girl. Better than Annie, anyhow.’</p>

<p>Yes, better than Annie; but less good&mdash;ah, how much less good&mdash;than
young beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_177">{177}</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s all right, then,’ he said, cheerful again. ‘Nothing like
coughing things up.’</p>

<p>No&mdash;Edgar was too rough a diamond, Mrs. Luke said to herself, shrinking
from this dreadful phrase. She hadn’t heard this one before. Was there
no end to his dreadful phrases?</p>

<p>‘He is much annoyed,’ she said, her eyebrows still drawn together with
the pain Mr. Thorpe’s last sentence had given her.</p>

<p>‘Annoyed, eh? Annoyed, is he? I like that,’ said Mr. Thorpe vehemently,
his cheerfulness vanishing. Annoyed because his mother was making a
rattling good match? Annoyed because the richest man for miles round was
taking her on for the rest of her life? Of all the insolent puppies....</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe had no words with which to express his opinion of Jocelyn; no
words, that is, fit for a drawing-room&mdash;he supposed the room he was in
would be called a drawing-room, though he was blest if there was a
single stick of stuff in it to justify such a name&mdash;for, having now seen
Sally, his feeling for Jocelyn, which had been one of simple
contemptuous indifference, had changed into something much more active.
Fancy <i>him</i> getting her, he thought&mdash;him, with only a beggarly five
hundred a year, him, who wouldn’t even be able to dress her properly.
Why, a young beauty like that ought to be a blaze of diamonds, and never
put her feet to the ground except to step out of a Rolls.</p>

<p>‘I’m very sorry, Edgar,’ said Mrs. Luke, ‘but he says he doesn’t wish to
accept your hospitality.’</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t wish, eh? Doesn’t wish, does he? I like that,’ said Mr. Thorpe,
more vehemently still.</p>

<p>That his good-natured willingness to help Marge out<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_178">{178}</a></span> of a fix, and his
elaborate preparations for the comfort of the first guests he had had
for years should be flouted in this way not only angered but hurt him.
And what would the servants say? And he had taken such pains to have the
bridal suite filled with everything calculated to make the young prig,
who thought his sorts of brains were the only ones worth having, see for
himself that they weren’t. Brains, indeed. What was the good of brains
that you couldn’t get enough butter out of to butter your bread
properly? Dry-bread brains, that’s what this precious prig’s were.
Crust-and-cold-water brains. Brains? Pooh.</p>

<p>This last word Mr. Thorpe said out loud; very loud; and Mrs. Luke shrank
again. It strangely afflicted her when he said pooh.</p>

<p>‘And I’m afraid,’ she went on, her voice extra gentle, for it did seem
to her that considering the position she had found him in Edgar was
behaving rather high-handedly, ‘that if he knew you had kissed his wife,
kissed her in the way you did kiss her, he might still less wish to.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Now</i> we’ve got it!’ burst out Mr. Thorpe, slapping his thigh. ‘<i>Now</i>
we’re getting down to brass tacks!’</p>

<p>‘Brass tacks, Edgar?’ said Mrs. Luke, to whom this expression, too, was
unfamiliar.</p>

<p>‘Spite,’ said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘Spite?’ repeated Mrs. Luke, her grey eyes very wide.</p>

<p>‘Feminine spite. Don’t believe a word about him not wanting to come and
stay at my place. You’ve made it up. Because I kissed the girl.’</p>

<p>And Mr. Thorpe in his anger inquired of Mrs. Luke whether she had ever
heard about hell holding no fury<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_179">{179}</a></span> like a woman scorned&mdash;for in common
with other men who know little poetry he knew that&mdash;and he also called
her Marge to her face, because he no longer saw any reason why he
shouldn’t.</p>

<p>‘My <i>dear</i> Edgar,’ was all she could find to say, her shoulders drawn up
slightly to her ears as if to ward off these blows of speech, violence
never yet having crossed her path.</p>

<p>She didn’t get angry herself. She behaved with dignity. She remembered
that she was a lady.</p>

<p>She did, however, at last suggest that perhaps it would be better if he
went away, for not only was he making more noise than she cared
about&mdash;really a most noisy man, she thought, gliding to the window and
softly shutting it&mdash;but it had occurred to her as a possibility that
Salvatia, out in the back garden, might be telling Jocelyn that Mr.
Thorpe had kissed her, and that on hearing this Jocelyn, who in any case
was upset, might be further upset into coming and joining Edgar and
herself in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>This, she was sure, would be a pity; so she suggested to Mr. Thorpe that
he should go.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’m <i>going</i> all right,’ said Mr. Thorpe, who somehow, instead of
being the one to be wigged, was the one who was wigging.</p>

<p>‘We’ll talk it all over quietly to-morrow, dear Edgar,’ said Mrs. Luke,
attempting to placate.</p>

<p>‘Dear Edgar, eh?’ retorted Mr. Thorpe, not to be shaken by fair words
from his conviction that Marge regarded herself as a woman scorned, and
therefore that she outrivalled the worst of the ladies of hell. ‘Fed-up
Edgar’s more like it,’ he said; and strode, banging doors, out of the
house.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_180">{180}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Mrs. Luke stood motionless where he had left her. What an unexpected
turn things had taken. How very violent Edgar really was; and how rude.
A woman scorned? Feminine spite? Such expressions, applied to herself,
would be merely ludicrous if they hadn’t, coming from Edgar in
connection with Salvatia, been so extraordinarily rude.</p>

<p>In connection with Salvatia. She paused on the thought. All this was
because of Salvatia. From beginning to end, everything unpleasant and
difficult that had happened to her during the last few weeks was because
of Salvatia.</p>

<p>But she mustn’t be unfair. If Salvatia had been the cause of her
engagement to Edgar, she was now being the cause of its breaking off.
For surely, surely, breaking off was the only course to take?</p>

<p>‘Let me <i>think</i>,’ said Mrs. Luke, pressing her hand to her forehead,
which was burning.</p>

<p>Yes; surely no amount of money could make up for the rest of Edgar?
Surely no amount, however great, could make up for the hourly fret and
discomfort of having to live with the wrong sort&mdash;no, not necessarily
the wrong sort, but the entirely different sort, corrected Mrs. Luke, at
pains to be just&mdash;of mind? Besides, of what use could she be to Jocelyn
and Salvatia, married to Edgar, if Jocelyn wouldn’t go near him, and
Salvatia couldn’t because of his amorousness? It would merely make the
cleavage between herself and Jocelyn complete at the very moment when he
more than ever before in his life needed her. And the grotesqueness of
accusing <i>her</i>, who had remained so quiet and calm, of being a fury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_181">{181}</a></span>
the sheer imbecility of imagining <i>her</i> actuated by feminine spite!
Really, really, said Mrs. Luke to herself, drawing her shoulders up to
her ears again at the recollection. And then there was&mdash;no, she turned
her mind away from those expressions of his; she positively couldn’t
bear to think of cough it up, bunkum, and pooh.</p>

<p>She went to her little desk and sat down to write a letter to Mr.
Thorpe, because in some circumstances letters are so much the best; nor
did she want to lose any time, in case it should occur to him too to
write a letter, and it seemed to her important that when it comes to
shedding anybody one should get there first, and be the shedder rather
than the shed; and she had got as far as <i>Dear Edgar, I feel that I owe
it to you</i>&mdash;when Jocelyn appeared in the doorway, with blazing eyes.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>What had taken place in the garden between Jocelyn and Sally was this:</p>

<p>She had gone out obediently to him, as she had been told. ‘Do as you’re
told,’ her father and mother had taught her, ‘and not much can go wrong
with you.’ Innocent Pinners. Inadequate teaching. It was to lead her,
before she had done, into many difficulties.</p>

<p>She went, then, as she had been told, over to where she saw Jocelyn, and
sat down beside him beneath the cedar.</p>

<p>He didn’t move, and didn’t look up, and she sat for a long while not
daring to speak, because of the expression on his face.</p>

<p>Naturally she thought it was his stomach again, for what else could it
be? Last time she had seen him he was smiling as happy as happy, and
kissing his mothe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_182">{182}</a></span>r’s hand. Clear to Sally as daylight was it that he
was having another of those attacks to which her father had been such a
martyr, and which were familiar to the Pinners under the name of the Dry
Heaves. So too had her father sat when they came on, frowning hard at
nothing, and looking just like ink. The only difference was that
Jocelyn, she supposed because of being a gentleman, held his head in his
hands, and her father held the real place the heaves were in. But
presently, when the simple remedy he took on these occasions had begun
to work, he was better; and it seemed to Sally a great pity that she
should be too much afraid of Usband to tell him about it,&mdash;a great pity,
and wrong as well. Hadn’t she promised God in church the day she was
married to look after him in sickness and in health? And here he was
sick, plain as a pikestaff.</p>

<p>So at last she pulled her courage together, and did tell him.</p>

<p>‘Father’s stomach,’ she began timidly, ‘was just like that.’</p>

<p>‘What?’ said Jocelyn, roused from his black thoughts by this surprising
remark, and turning his head and looking at her.</p>

<p>‘You got the same stomachs,’ said Sally, shrinking under his look but
continuing to hold on to her courage, ‘you and Father ’as. Like as two
peas.’</p>

<p>Jocelyn stared at her. What, in the name of all that was fantastic, had
Pinner’s stomach to do with him?</p>

<p>‘Sit just like that, ’e would, when they come on,’ continued Sally,
lashing herself forward.</p>

<p>‘Do you mind,’ requested Jocelyn with icy politeness, ‘making yourself
clear?’</p>

<p>‘Now, Mr. Luke, don’t&mdash;please don’t talk that way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_183">{183}</a></span> begged Sally. ‘I
only want to tell you what Father did when they come on.’</p>

<p>‘When what comes on, and where?’</p>

<p>‘These ’ere dry ’eaves,’ said Sally. ‘You’d be better if you’d take what
Father did. ’Ad them somethin’ awful, ’e did. And you’d be better&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But her voice faded away. When Jocelyn looked at her like that and said
not a word, her voice didn’t seem able to go on talking, however hard
she tried to make it.</p>

<p>And Jocelyn’s thoughts grew if possible blacker. This was to be his
life’s companion&mdash;his <i>life’s</i>, mind you, he said to himself. Alone and
unaided, he was to live out the years with her. A child; and presently
not a child. A beauty; and presently not a beauty. But always to the
end, now that his mother had deserted him, unadulterated Pinner.</p>

<p>‘There’s an h in heaves,’ he said, glowering at her, his gloom really
inspissate. ‘I don’t know what the beastly things are, but I’m sure
they’ve got an h in them.’</p>

<p>‘Sorry,’ breathed Sally humbly, casting down her eyes before his look.</p>

<p>Then he became aware of the unusual flush on her face,&mdash;one side was
quite scarlet.</p>

<p>‘Why are you so red?’ he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Me?’ said Sally, starting at the peremptoriness in his tone.
‘Oh&mdash;<i>that</i>.’</p>

<p>She put up her hand and felt her burning cheek. ‘Father-in-law,’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘Father <i>who</i>?’ asked Jocelyn, astonished out of his gloom.</p>

<p>‘In-law,’ said Sally. ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Im in the ’ouse. The old gentleman,’ she
explained, as Jocelyn stared in greater and greater astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_184">{184}</a></span></p>

<p>Thorpe? The man who was to be his stepfather? But why&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>A flash of something quite, quite horrible darted into his mind. ‘But
why,’ he asked, ‘are you so very red? What has that to do&mdash;&mdash;?’</p>

<p>He broke off, and caught hold of her wrist.</p>

<p>‘Daresay it ain’t the gentleman’s day for shavin’,’ suggested Sally.</p>

<p>And on Jocelyn’s flinging away her wrist and jumping up, she watched him
running indoors with recovered complacency. ‘Soon be better now,’ she
said to herself, pleased; for her father always ran like that too, just
when the heaves were going to leave off.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>And she was right. Next time she saw him, which was at supper, he was
quite well. His face had cleared, he could eat his food, and he kissed
the top of her head as he passed behind her to his chair.</p>

<p>‘Well, <i>that’s</i> over,’ thought Sally, much relieved, though still
remaining, through her lowered eyelashes, watchful and cautious. With
these Lukes one never knew what was going to happen next; and as she sat
doing her anxious best with the forks and other pitfalls of the meal,
and the little maid came in and out, free in her movements, independent,
able to give notice and go at any moment she chose, Sally couldn’t help
comparing her lot with her own, and thinking that Ammond was singularly
blest. And then she thought what a wicked girl she was to have such
thoughts, and bent her head lower over her plate in shame, and Mrs. Luke
said gently, ‘Sit up, dear child.’</p>

<p>That night a bed was made for Jocelyn on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_185">{185}</a></span>sitting-room sofa, Sally
slept upstairs in the tiny Spartan room he used to sleep in, and
Abergeldie wasn’t mentioned. Nor did they have Mr. Thorpe’s salmon for
supper, because the idea of eating poor Edgar’s gift seemed, in the
circumstances, cynical to Mrs. Luke; so Hammond ate it, and never
afterwards could be got to touch fish.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe had now become poor Edgar to Mrs. Luke. Only a few hours
before, he had been thought of as a godsend. Well, he shouldn’t have
kissed Salvatia. But indeed what a mercy that he had, for it brought
clarity into what had been troubled and obscure. Without this
action&mdash;and it wasn’t just kissing, it was enjoyment&mdash;Mrs. Luke would,
she knew, have gone stumbling on, doing her duty by him, trying to get
everybody to like each other and be happy in the way that was so
obviously the best for them, the way which would quite certainly have
been the best for them if poor Edgar had been as decent as, at his age,
it was reasonable to expect. She could, she was sure, have managed
Jocelyn, for had she not managed him all his life? And after marriage
she could, she had no doubt, have managed Edgar too; but what hard work
it would have been, what a ceaseless weeding, to take only one aspect of
him, of his language!</p>

<p>The enjoyment&mdash;it was the only word for it&mdash;with which he had kissed
Salvatia had spared her all these pains. Certainly it was beneath her
dignity, beyond her patience, altogether outside any possible
compensation by wealth, to marry and manage a man who enjoyed kissing
other women. That she couldn’t do. She could do much, but not that. Like
the Canon’s wife, she would have forgiven everything except enjoyment.
And she wrote an urbane letter&mdash;why not?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_186">{186}</a></span> Surely finality can afford to
be urbane?&mdash;after having had a talk with Jocelyn when he arrived with
blazing eyes in the sitting-room, a talk which began in
violence&mdash;his,&mdash;and continued in patience&mdash;hers,&mdash;and ended in
peace&mdash;theirs; and by the time they sat down to supper the letter,
sealed&mdash;it seemed to be the sort of letter one ought to seal&mdash;was
already lying in the pillar box at the corner of the road, and the last
trying weeks were wiped out as though they had never been.</p>

<p>At least, that was Mrs. Luke’s firm intention, that they should be wiped
out; and she thought as she gazed at Jocelyn, so content again, eating a
supper purged of the least reminder of Mr. Thorpe, that the <i>status quo
ante</i> was now thoroughly restored. Ah, happy <i>status quo ante</i>, thought
Mrs. Luke, whose mind was well-furnished with pieces of Latin, happy
<i>status quo ante</i>, with her boy close knit to her again, more than ever
unable to do without her, and she in her turn finding the very breath of
her being and reason for her existence in him and all his concerns. Not
a cloud was now between them. She had quickly reassured him as to
Salvatia’s red cheek,&mdash;Mr. Thorpe’s greeting, she had explained, was
purely perfunctory, and witnessed by herself, but the child had such a
delicate skin that a touch would mark it.</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t ever bruise her,’ she had said, smiling. ‘It would show for
weeks.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mother!’ Jocelyn had said, smiling too, so happy, he too, to know
he had been lifted out of the region of angers, out of the black places
where people bruise hearts, not bodies, and in so doing mangle their
own.</p>

<p>Yes, she could manage Jocelyn. Tact and patience were all that was
needed. Never, never should he know<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_187">{187}</a></span> of Edgar’s amorousness, any more
than he was ever, ever to know of Edgar’s other drawbacks. Let him think
of him in the future as the kind, reliable rich man who once had wanted
to marry her, but whom she had refused for her boy’s sake. She made this
sacrifice willingly, happily, for her darling son&mdash;so she gave Jocelyn
to understand, during the talk they had alone together in the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>The truth? No, not altogether the truth, she admitted as she sat eating
her supper, her pure, pure supper, with all those horrible gross
delicacies, under which she had so long groaned, banished out of sight,
her glance resting fondly first on her boy, and then in amazed
admiration, renewed with a start each time she looked at her, on the
flame of loveliness that was her boy’s wife. No; what she had said to
Jocelyn in the sitting-room wasn’t altogether the truth, she admitted
that, but the mutilated form of it called tact. Or, rather, not
mutilated, which suggested disfigurement, but pruned. Pruned truth.
Truth pruned into acceptability to susceptibility. Was not that tact?
Was not that the nearest one dared go in speech with the men one loved?
They seemed not able to bear truth whole. Children, they were. And the
geniuses&mdash;she smiled proudly and fondly at Jocelyn’s dark head bent over
his plate&mdash;were the simplest children of them all.</p>

<p>Yes, she thought, the <i>status quo ante</i> was indeed restored, and
everything was going to be as it used to be. The only difference was
Salvatia.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Before a week was over Mrs. Luke left out the word ‘only’ from this
sentence, and was inclined to say&mdash;again<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_188">{188}</a></span> with Wordsworth; curious how
that, surely antiquated, poet cropped up&mdash;<i>But oh, the difference</i>,
instead. Salvatia was&mdash;well, why had one been given intelligence if not
to cope, among other things, with what Salvatia was?</p>

<p>That first night of reunion with Jocelyn, Mrs. Luke had lain awake
nearly all of it, making plans. Very necessary, very urgent it was to
get them cut and dried by the morning. The headache she had had earlier
in the evening vanished before the imperativeness of thinking and seeing
clearly. Many things had to be thought out and decided, some of them
sordid, such as the question of living now that there was another mouth
to feed, and others difficult, such as the best line to take with South
Winch in regard to Mr. Thorpe. She thought and thought, lying on her
back, her hands clasped behind her head, staring into the darkness,
frowning in her concentration.</p>

<p>Towards morning she saw that the line to take with South Winch about
poor Edgar was precisely the line she had taken with Jocelyn: she had
given up the hope of marriage, she would say, so as to be able to devote
herself exclusively to her boy and his wife.</p>

<p>‘See,’ she would say, indicating Salvatia, careful at once to draw
attention to what anyhow, directly the child began to speak, couldn’t
remain unnoticed, ‘how this untrained, delicious baby needs me. No
mother, no education, no idea of what the world demands&mdash;could I
possibly, thinking only of myself, selfishly leave her without help and
guidance? I do feel the young have a very great claim on us.’ And then
she would add that as long as she lived she would never forget how well,
how splendidly, Mr. Thorpe had behaved.</p>

<p>Pruned truth, again. And truth pruned, she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_189">{189}</a></span> afraid, in a way that
would cover her with laurels she hadn’t deserved. But what was she to
do? One needs must find the easiest and best way out of a
difficulty,&mdash;easiest and best for those one loves.</p>

<p>In order, however, to indicate Salvatia and explain things by means of
her, Mrs. Luke would have to produce her, have to show her to South
Winch, and in order to do that she would have to give a party. Yes; she
would give a party, a tea-party, and invite every one she knew to
it&mdash;except, of course, Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke had hitherto been sparing of parties, considering them not
only difficult with one servant, and wastefully expensive, but also so
very ordinary. Anybody not too positively poor could give tea-parties,
and invite a lot of people and let them entertain each other. She chose
the better way, which was to have one friend, at most two, at a time,
and really talk, really exchange ideas, over a simple but attractive
tea. Of course the friends had to have ideas, or one couldn’t exchange
them. But now she would have a real party, with no ideas and many
friends, the sort of party called an At Home, and at it Salvatia should
be revealed to South Winch in all her wonder.</p>

<p>The party, however, couldn’t be given for at least a week, because of
first having to drill Salvatia. A week wasn’t much; was, indeed,
terribly little; but if the drill were intensive, Mrs. Luke thought she
could get the child’s behaviour into sufficient shape to go on with by
the end of it.</p>

<p>Hidden indoors&mdash;and in any case they would both at first hide indoors
from a possible encounter with poor Edgar&mdash;she would devote the whole of
every day to exercising Salvatia in the art of silence. That was all
she<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_190">{190}</a></span> needed to be perfect: silence. And how few words were really
necessary for a girl with a face like that! No need whatever to exert
herself,&mdash;her face did everything for her. Yes; no; please; thank you;
what couldn’t be done with just these, if accompanied by that heavenly
smile? Why, if she kept only to these, if she carefully refrained from
more, from, especially, the use of any out of her own deplorable stock,
it wouldn’t even be necessary for Mrs. Luke to say anything about her
having had no education; and if she could be trained to add, ‘So kind of
you,’ at the proper moment, and perhaps, ‘Yes, we are very happy,’ her
success would be overwhelming.</p>

<p>But almost immediately on beginning the drill, which she did the next
day, Mrs. Luke perceived that this last sentence must be dropped. Poor
Salvatia. The poor child was precluded from speaking of happiness,
because of its h. Really rather sad, when one came to think of it. She
could, relatively easily, be taught to speak of sorrow, of pain, of
misfortune, of sickness and of death, but she couldn’t be taught, not in
a week Mrs. Luke was afraid, to speak of happiness.</p>

<p>Well, Rome wasn’t built in a day. ‘We must be patient,’ she said,
smiling at Sally, who seemed to tumble over herself in her haste to
smile back.</p>

<p>Almond Tree Cottage was now the scene of tireless activity. The At Home
was fixed for the following Thursday week,&mdash;eight days ahead; and Mrs.
Luke sent Jocelyn off to Cambridge the very morning after he arrived, in
order to rearrange matters with his College and look about, as he seemed
bent on it, for a suitable little house for them all, though she
privately was bent on staying where she was, and keeping Sally with
her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_191">{191}</a></span> But it did no harm to let him look, and it kept him out of the way
for a couple of days, in case Mr. Thorpe should think fit to come round
in person, instead of writing. And, having cleared the field, she
settled down to devoting herself entirely to Sally.</p>

<p>But Sally, seeing Jocelyn preparing to depart&mdash;for some time she
couldn’t believe her eyes&mdash;without going to take her too, was smitten
into speech.</p>

<p>‘You ain’t goin’ to leave me ’ere, Mr. Luke?’ she asked in tones of
horrified incredulity, when at last it began to look exactly as if he
were.</p>

<p>‘Two days only, darling,’ said Jocelyn. ‘And you’ll be very happy with
my mother.’</p>

<p>‘But&mdash;can’t I come with you? I wouldn’t be no trouble. I&mdash;I’d do
anything sooner than&mdash;’</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder; Mrs. Luke, however, was in the kitchen
giving her orders for the day.</p>

<p>‘&mdash;be as ’appy as all that,’ she finished, under her breath.</p>

<p>‘I shall be much too busy, darling,’ said Jocelyn, pleased at the way
she was taking their first separation, and not hearing the last words
because he was rummaging among coats.</p>

<p>‘There’s Father,’ persisted Sally anxiously. ‘<i><span class="lftspc">’</span>E</i> could take me in. I
wouldn’t be no trouble to nobody&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Darling, I’m afraid it can’t possibly be managed,’ said Jocelyn, very
thankful to leave her safe with his mother; but she looked so enchanting
in her obvious sorrow at being parted from him that he took her in his
arms, and kissed her warmly.</p>

<p>‘<i>Kissin’s</i> no good,’ said Sally. ‘Goin’ too’s what I’d like.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_192">{192}</a></span>’</p>

<p>‘And if I took you too, my beautiful one,’ whispered Jocelyn, flaming up
at the touch of her, ‘I’d do nothing but kiss you instead of doing my
business&mdash;&mdash;’ which wasn’t true, but with Sally in his arms he thought
it was; besides, they had been separated for a whole night.</p>

<p>‘Turtle doves&mdash;oh, <i>turtle</i> doves!’ exclaimed Mrs. Luke, managing to
smile, though she didn’t like it, when she came out of the kitchen and
found them locked together; for this was happening in what Mr. Thorpe
refused to call the hall.</p>

<p>And later on when Jocelyn had gone, she put her arm through Sally’s, who
was standing at the window staring after him as though it couldn’t be
true that he had really left her, and drew her away into the little
dining-room at the back of the house, because of its greater
privacy&mdash;she had to consider the possible movements of Mr. Thorpe&mdash;and
at once began to put the plans she had made in the night into practice,
not only taking immense pains with the child’s words and pronunciation,
but leaving no stone unturned&mdash;‘As the quaint phrase goes,’ she said,
smiling at Sally, for why hide her intentions?&mdash;in order to win her
confidence and love.</p>

<p>Sally was most depressed. She didn’t want to love&mdash;‘Too much of that
about as it is,’ she thought,&mdash;and she hadn’t an idea what her
confidence was.</p>

<p>The table was arranged with paper and ink, and Mrs. Luke began by
kissing her affectionately, and telling her that they were now going to
be very busy and happy. ‘Like bees,’ said Mrs. Luke, looking cheerful
and encouraging, but also terrifyingly clever, with her clear grey eyes
that seemed to see everything all at once and never were half as much
pleased as her mouth was.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_193">{193}</a></span> ‘You know how bees store up honey&mdash;the
bright, golden honey, don’t you, dear. Say honey, Salvatia dear. Say it
after me&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Sally was most depressed. Mixed up with her efforts to say honey were
puzzled thoughts about her husband’s having left her. She understood,
from her study of the Bible, that one of the principal jobs of husbands
was to cleave to their wives. Till death, the Bible said. Nobody had
died. It wasn’t cleaving to go away to Cambridge and leave her high and
dry with the lady. And though Usband was often very strange, he wasn’t
anything like as strange as the lady; and though he often frightened
her, there were moments when he didn’t frighten her at all&mdash;when, on the
contrary, she seemed able to do pretty much as she liked with him. And
she had great hopes that some day she and he would get on quite nicely
together, once they had set up housekeeping and he went off first thing
after breakfast to his work, and she got everything tidy and ready for
him when he came back to his dinner. Yes; she and Usband would settle
down nicely then. And later on, when she had a little baby&mdash;Sally
thought frequently and complacently of the time when she would have a
little baby, several little babies&mdash;things would be as pleasant as could
be. All she wanted, so as to be happy, was no lady, a couple of rooms,
Usband to do her duty by, God’s Word to study, and every now and then a
little baby. It was all she asked. It was her idea of bliss. That, and
being let alone.</p>

<p>‘Peace an’ quiet,’ she said to herself, as she sat painfully trying, at
Mrs. Luke’s request, to discuss with her the habits of bees. She hadn’t
known they had any habits. She doubted whether she would know a bee if<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_194">{194}</a></span>
she saw one. There were no bees in Islington. Wasps, now&mdash;she knew a
thing or two about wasps. Raw onion was the stuff for when they
stung.... ‘Peace an’ quiet,’ she said to herself. ‘All one asks. This
ain’t neither.’</p>

<p>In an agony of application Sally perspired through the two days of
Jocelyn’s absence. Lessons didn’t leave off when the paper and ink were
cleared away because of the rissoles of lunch and the poached eggs of
supper, but went on just as bad while she was eating. ‘Salvatia dear,
don’t ’old your fork like that&mdash;&mdash;’ ‘Salvatia dear, don’t go makin’ all
that there noise when you drinks&mdash;&mdash;’ so did Mrs. Luke’s admonishments
present themselves to Sally’s ill-attuned ear. And after that the
lessons were continued in the garden, where she was walked up and down,
up and down, till her head, as she said to herself, fair reeled. Never
before had Sally been walked up and down the same spot. She used to walk
straight sometimes to places, and then come home again and done with it,
but never up and down and keeping on turning round. No escape. The lady
had her by the arm. Exercise, she called it. And talk! Not only talk
herself, but keep on dragging her into it too. Education, the lady
called it. Lessons, that’s to say. What ones these Lukes were for
lessons, thought Sally, remembering her experience at St. Mawes. And
there, through the kitchen window every time she passed it, she could
see Ammond, washing up as free as air.</p>

<p>The garden was small; the turnings accordingly frequent; and Sally’s
head, strained by the excessive attention Mrs. Luke insisted on, did
indeed reel. Her head.... How was it, Mrs. Luke was asking herself by
the evening of that first day, ostensibly pleasantly chatting, but
carefully observing Sally, who, pale and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_195">{195}</a></span> beautiful, with faint shadows
under her eyes, sat looking at her lap so as not to see the lady looking
at her,&mdash;how was it that so noble a little head, with a brow so happily
formed, one would have supposed, for the harbouring of intelligence,
should apparently be without any?</p>

<p>Apparently. Mrs. Luke was careful not to come to any hasty conclusion,
but by this time she had been drilling Sally ceaselessly for a whole
day, and she had been so clear and patient, and so very, very simple,
that she began to think her vocation was probably that of a teacher; yet
no sign of real comprehension had up to then appeared. Goodwill there
was; much goodwill. But no real <i>grasp</i>. And, of course, most lamentably
little ear. Those h’s&mdash;it would have been disheartening, if Mrs. Luke
hadn’t refused to be disheartened, the way Salvatia didn’t even seem to
know if they were in a word or not. She simply didn’t hear them.</p>

<p>‘Do you like music, Salvatia?’ said Mrs. Luke, getting up and preparing
to test her ear on the clavichord at the other end of the room, an
instrument which gave her great pleasure because it wasn’t so gross as a
piano.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Sally, who had been strictly drilled that day in naked
monosyllables.</p>

<p>‘Do you sing, dear child?’</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ymns,’ said Sally.</p>

<p>‘Ah, dear, <i>dearest</i> child!’ cried Mrs. Luke, drawing her shoulders up
to her ears, for after all the pains and labours of the day she was
tired, and she couldn’t help being, perhaps, a little less patient. ‘How
do you spell that poor small word? It is such a tiny, short word, and
can’t afford to lose any of its letters&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And in the kitchen, Sally knew, with her hearth swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_196">{196}</a></span> and neat, and
everything put nicely away for the day, sat Ammond, doing her sewing as
free as air.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Jocelyn came home on the evening of the third day. He hadn’t found a
house, and seemed dispirited about that, and looked a great deal at
Salvatia, Mrs. Luke thought,&mdash;almost as if he had never seen her before;
indeed he looked at her so much that he hardly had eyes or attention for
anything else.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke didn’t like it.</p>

<p>Certainly the girl was quite extraordinarily beautiful that evening, and
seemed even more alight than usual with the strange, surprising
flame-effect she somehow made, but one would have supposed that these
outwardnesses, once one knew that they were not the symbols of any
corresponding inwardnesses, could hardly be sufficient for a man like
Jocelyn.</p>

<p>A little pang of something that hurt&mdash;it couldn’t of course be jealousy,
for the very word in such a connection was ludicrous&mdash;shot through Mrs.
Luke’s heart when she more than once caught a look in her boy’s eyes as
they rested on his wife that she had never seen in any man’s eyes when
they rested on her herself, but which she nevertheless instantly
recognised. The love-look. The look of burning, impatient passion. She
had been loved, but never like that, never with that intent adoration.</p>

<p>Sally sat quietly there, neither speaking nor moving, but over her face
rippled gladness. Nice, she thought, to get Usband back. It hadn’t been
half awful without him. Finished now, though; wouldn’t happen again.
‘Let’s forget it,’ she said to herself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>And that night, after every one was in bed, Mrs. Luke heard cautious
steps creaking up the stairs, and the door of the room Sally slept in
across the little landing was softly opened, and some one went in and
softly shut it again; and Mrs. Luke didn’t like it at all, and ended by
crying herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Next day, however, Jocelyn was restored to the self she knew, and was
reasonable and detached. They talked over the house in Cambridge
question, and he quite agreed with his mother that when he went up,
which he was due to do in nine days time, while he continued in his
spare moments there to search for one she would keep Sally with her at
Almond Tree Cottage.</p>

<p>‘And even if you find one, dearest,’ said Mrs. Luke, ‘remember we can’t
afford to take it till I have got rid of this one.’</p>

<p>‘Quite, Mother,’ said Jocelyn&mdash;so reasonable, so completely detached.</p>

<p>‘And meanwhile, the best thing will be for Salvatia to stay quietly here
with me.’</p>

<p>‘Far and away the best, Mother,’ said Jocelyn, whose thoughts had gone
off with renewed eagerness to his work, to the two spacious months of
undisturbed labour ahead of him in those quiet rooms of his in Austen’s
Court.</p>

<p>What was Sally’s surprise to find that Jocelyn’s return made no
difference to the lessons. They went on just the same; indeed, they
seemed every day to get worse, and he, except at meals and when he crept
into her room at night, stayed at the top of the house shut up by
himself, or went out for his daily walk after lunch and didn’t take her
with him.</p>

<p>At night she tried to ask him about these things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_198">{198}</a></span> because this was the
time he was most likely to answer, but he only whispered, ‘Hush&mdash;Mother
will hear.’</p>

<p>‘Not if you whispers,’ whispered Sally.</p>

<p>‘She’d hear the whispers,’ whispered Jocelyn.</p>

<p>Why Mother shouldn’t hear whispers Sally was unable to make out.</p>

<p>And there at night was Usband, all for being friendly and loving, and in
the day didn’t seem to know she was alive. Warmed up a bit, he did,
towards evening, but else sat hardly opening his mouth, his eyes looking
at something that wasn’t there. Was this, Sally might well in her turn
have asked if she had been able to formulate such a question,
companionship? But even if she had formulated it she wouldn’t have asked
it, because she was so meek.</p>

<p>Strange, however, how the meek go on being meek till the very moment
when they do something from which bold persons would shrink. This is
what Sally did, after having progressed that week steadily towards
despair.</p>

<p>Gradually but steadily, by piecing together bit by bit the things Mrs.
Luke and Jocelyn said to each other at meals and in the evening, she
became aware of what was in store for her. First, a party; an enormous
party, at which everybody who wasn’t a gentleman was going to be a lady;
and she was to be at it too, and it was for this that her mind and
manners were being fattened up so ceaselessly by Mrs. Luke. Then, two
days after the party, Jocelyn, her husband who had promised in church to
cherish her, was going away to Cambridge, and going to stay there by
himself till the summer, just as if he weren’t married. How could he
cherish her from Cambridge? It was evident even to Sally that it
couldn’t be done. Finally, she was to be left at Almond Tree<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_199">{199}</a></span> Cottage
alone with Mrs. Luke, being educated, being made fit, being fattened
inside just as you fatten animals outside. What for? She hadn’t married
Mrs. Luke. Wasn’t she able, just as she was, to be a good wife to
Usband, and a good mother later on to the little babies? What more could
a girl do than be ready to work her fingers to the bone for him? And she
could cook so nicely, give her a chance; and she could mend as well as
any one; and as for keeping the house clean, hadn’t her mother taught
her never to dream of sitting down and taking up her sewing while there
was so much as a single speck of dirt about?</p>

<p>With growing horror, and steadily increasing despair, Sally listened to
the talk at meals. She had learned to say nothing now but yes, no, thank
you, and please, and either kept her eyes on her plate or, through her
eyelashes, watched with pangs of envy the happy Hammond’s free entrances
and departures. She herself never moved without Mrs. Luke’s arm through
hers or round her shoulders,&mdash;‘We are quite inseparable,’ Mrs. Luke
would say, smiling at Jocelyn, when the meals were over and the time had
arrived for going somewhere else, as she either encircled Sally’s
shrinking shoulder or put her hand through her limp arm. ‘Aren’t we,
Salvatia?’</p>

<p>And Sally, starting&mdash;she had got into a curious habit, which Mrs. Luke
much deplored, of starting when she was spoken to, however
gently&mdash;hurriedly said, ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Queer, thought Mrs. Luke, who noticed everything but was without the
power of correct deduction, seeing that the child so obviously was
anxious to please and she herself so certainly was anxious to help her,
queer how difficult it was to do anything with her in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_200">{200}</a></span>
confidence and love. And to Jocelyn in the evenings, after Sally had
been told she was tired and must wish to go to bed, which she quickly
learnt meant that she was to get up at once and say goodnight and go to
it, Mrs. Luke would talk about her lovingly and humorously, and
laughingly describe what she called the intensive methods of cultivation
she was applying to the marvellous child.</p>

<p>‘You’ll see how beautifully she’ll behave at our little party,’ she
said. ‘And as for what she’ll be like after a few months&mdash;well, dearest,
all I can say is that I promise to hand her over to you fit to be your
real companion, and not only&mdash;’ Mrs. Luke shivered slightly at the
thought of the creaking stairs&mdash;‘just a wife.’</p>

<p>Two evenings before the day of the party, Mrs. Luke, who had made, she
knew, no headway at all in spite of the most untiring efforts in winning
the confidence and love she expected, remarked hesitatingly, when she
and Jocelyn were alone together after Sally’s departure for bed, that
the child appeared to have rather curious and disconcerting resistances.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean she doesn’t obey you?’ asked Jocelyn, much surprised.</p>

<p>‘Oh, with almost too much eagerness. No. I mean something mental. Or
rather,’ amended Mrs. Luke, who by this time was definitely disappointed
in Sally’s mind but was still prepared to concede her a soul,
‘spiritual. Spiritual resistances. Disconcerting <i>spiritual</i>
resistances. She seems to shut herself up. And I ask myself, what in? A
child like that, with a&mdash;well, really rather blank mind at present. What
is she withdrawing into? Where does she <i>go</i>, Jocelyn?’</p>

<p>And that night when, having given his mother time to go to sleep and the
house was quiet, Jocelyn stole upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_201">{201}</a></span> to Sally, full of nothing but
love for her, she made a scene. He called it a scene; she called it
mentioning. She had screwed herself up to mentioning to him that it was
wrong to leave her, as she now beyond any possibility of doubt knew that
he was going to leave her, and go away by himself to Cambridge.</p>

<p>A scene with Sally. Jocelyn was as much amazed, and correspondingly
outraged, as if his fountain-pen had turned on him and declared that
what he was making it write was all wrong. For Sally took her stand on
the New Testament, on the Gospel of St. Mark, Chapter X, Verses 7 and 8,
and not only declared there was no mistaking the words, and that it
wasn’t his wife a man had to leave but his father and mother, and that
he had to leave them so as to cleave to his wife, and that they two were
to be one flesh, but asked him how he could either cleave or be one
flesh if he were in Cambridge and she in South Winch?</p>

<p>It was past midnight and pitch dark, so he couldn’t see her face, and
accordingly wasn’t bewitched. Also, he had found her waiting up for him,
not gone to bed at all, but dressed and sitting in a chair, so that,
again, he wasn’t bewitched. When one neither saw nor touched Sally it
was quite easy not to be bewitched.</p>

<p>‘For heaven’s sake don’t <i>talk</i>,’ he said in a low voice, when he had
got over his first astonishment. ‘Don’t you know Mother will hear?’</p>

<p>Sally couldn’t help that. She had got to say it. God was on her side.
His laws were going to be broken, and nothing made Sally so brave as
having to take up the cudgels in defence of God’s laws. Besides, if the
dark prevented Jocelyn from seeing her beauty it saved her from seeing
the icy displeased look on his face that made<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_202">{202}</a></span> her falter off into
silence. And she was in despair. Apart from the right or the wrong of
it, she felt she couldn’t possibly be left alone with Mrs. Luke.
Therefore, having mentioned God’s laws to him, she proceeded to entreat
him to take her with him, it didn’t matter into what hole, or let her go
to her father’s, and he come and see her whenever he had time.</p>

<p>‘I told you&mdash;I told you the other day,’ said Sally, trying to subdue her
voice to a whisper, but it kept on breaking through, ‘when you was only
goin’ to be away for two days that I didn’t ’alf like it. ’Ow do you
suppose I’m goin’ to like weeks and weeks? And it ain’t <i>right</i>, Mr.
Luke&mdash;it ain’t <i>right</i>. You only got to read St. Mark&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Jocelyn was amazed. Sally talking like this? Sally suddenly making
difficulties, and having an opinion, and judging? Dragging in the Bible,
too, just like somebody’s cook.</p>

<p>‘You don’t understand,’ he said in a low voice because of his mother,
but a voice quite as full of anger as if he had been shouting. ‘How can
you? What do you know about anything?’</p>

<p>‘I know what ain’t bein’ one flesh,’ persisted Sally, greatly helped in
the matter of courage by the dark.</p>

<p>He gathered his dressing-gown round him; it sounded exactly as if a
servant were daring to talk familiarly to him.</p>

<p>‘This isn’t the time,’ he whispered, infinitely disgusted, ‘to argue.’</p>

<p>‘P’raps you’ll tell me when the time is, then,’ said Sally, who knew she
could never be alone with him in the day because of Mrs. Luke; and
really in the dark, unable to see her, Jocelyn had the impression of
some<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_203">{203}</a></span> woman of the lower classes confronting him with arms akimbo.</p>

<p>‘Certainly not at one in the morning,’ he said freezingly. ‘I shall go
downstairs again. I didn’t come up here to listen to outrageous rot.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. <i>Luke</i>! Rot? When it’s God’s Word I’m talkin’ about? Ain’t you my
’usband? Didn’t you vow&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door.</p>

<p>‘You see?’ said Jocelyn, starting and extraordinarily put out that Mrs.
Luke should know he was in there. ‘You <i>have</i> disturbed my mother.’</p>

<p>‘What is it, Jocelyn?’ his mother’s voice asked anxiously from outside.</p>

<p>He opened the door. She too was in a dressing-gown, and her long hair
hung down in thick plaits.</p>

<p>‘What is it, Jocelyn?’ she asked again.</p>

<p>‘Only that Sally has gone out of her senses,’ he said shortly; and he
stalked away downstairs, ashamed to have been caught by his mother
upstairs, angry with himself for being ashamed, and seriously enraged
with Sally.</p>

<p>‘Salvatia, Jocelyn dearest&mdash;<i>do</i> remember,’ called Mrs. Luke plaintively
after him.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Christ!’ muttered Jocelyn, banging the sitting-room door behind him
and throwing himself on the hard narrow sofa from which, only a quarter
of an hour before, he had got up, all warm with love, to go to his wife.</p>

<p>And in the room overhead Mrs. Luke put her arms round Sally, and did her
best, while tactfully asking no questions, to soothe and calm the child.
But how can one soothe and calm anything that behaves exactly as if it
were a very rigid, unresponsive, and entirely dumb stone?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>There were explanations next day. Mrs. Luke put the whole situation
patiently and clearly before Sally. It wasn’t fair, she said to Jocelyn,
after a private talk with him during which he had told her the sorts of
things Sally had said in the night, it wasn’t fair to keep the child
quite in the dark as to their arrangements. Even if she weren’t
altogether able to understand, she should, Mrs. Luke said, be given the
opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>So when breakfast was cleared away, and Jocelyn had withdrawn to his
attic, Mrs. Luke shut herself up as usual with Sally in the dining-room,
and spent the morning patiently explaining.</p>

<p>Sally said nothing. This made it difficult for Mrs. Luke to know whether
she had understood. And yet how simple it was. Jocelyn’s work, the
paramount importance of his work, on which both his and Salvatia’s
future and perhaps&mdash;who knew?&mdash;the world’s, depended; their present, but
no doubt temporary, poverty, which made it out of the question for them
to follow him to Cambridge till Almond Tree Cottage had been let; the
necessity of teaching Salvatia, during long, quiet, uninterrupted days,
all the little odds and ends, so small and yet so indispensable, that go
to make up the wife of a gentleman; and the impossibility of asking
Jocelyn to leave his rooms in College and live in anything as
uncomfortable and makeshift as the sorts of lodgings within their means
were bound to be. Of course had Salvatia been alone in the world, and
with nowhere at all to go to, some such arrangement would have had to be
made. But she wasn’t alone. She had her husband’s mother, and her
husband’s mothe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_205">{205}</a></span>r’s home, and affection, and sympathy, and the warmest
welcome.</p>

<p>‘Just a little patience, Salvatia dear,’ said Mrs. Luke, ‘and our little
problems will all quite naturally solve themselves. We shall have got a
tenant for this house, Jocelyn will have found a nice home for us in
Cambridge, you will meanwhile have learnt everything necessary to make
you able to be its perfect little mistress, and we’ll all live happily
ever after.’</p>

<p>Now wasn’t this kind? Surely it was very kind, thought Mrs. Luke. And
wasn’t it loving? Surely it was altogether loving. Yet Salvatia said
never a word.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sally was necessarily dumb. She had too few words to enter into
controversy with Mrs. Luke, and knew that if she tried to she would only
collapse into tears. But after lunch, through which she sat saying
nothing, when Mrs. Luke sent her out into the garden alone because she
herself had to go down that afternoon to the shops to see about the
cakes for her party next day, Sally went to the one corner which wasn’t
overlooked by the windows of the house, owing to an intervening
tool-shed, and, leaning against the iron rails that separated Mrs.
Luke’s property from Mr. Thorpe’s, wept bitterly.</p>

<p>She clutched the top rail with both hands, and laying her head on them
wept most bitterly; for it was plain now to her that her dream of two
rooms and no lady was never to come true, and that meanwhile&mdash;what was
the good of blinking facts?&mdash;her husband had deserted her. And she had
no money; only five shillings her father had given her as a wedding
present,&mdash;that was all. Handsome as a present, but not enough, she was
sure, to get her home to him. If only she could go home to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_206">{206}</a></span> him, and
escape any more of Mrs. Luke, and escape the terrible, the
make-you-come-over-all-cold-to-think-of party! Then, when Usband arrived
at his college, she could turn up there and give him a surprise, and
find a room for herself somewhere close, and live in it as quiet as a
mouse, not bothering him at all or interrupting, but near enough to feel
still married.</p>

<p>Sally’s body was shaken by sobs; even the rail on which she leant her
head, her head with its bright, tumbled hair, whose ends, getting into
her eyes, were wet and darkened by her grief, was shaken. She could bear
no more. She couldn’t bear any more of anything in the house behind the
tool-shed. Yet what was she to do? Five shillings would get her
nowhere&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Crying, eh?’ said a voice on the other side of the fence.</p>

<p>And looking up with a great start, Sally beheld Father-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_207">{207}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Mr. Thorpe</span>, being a man accustomed all his life to success in everything
he undertook&mdash;except in the case of Annie, but even she had been a
success at first&mdash;had spent a week of bitterness.</p>

<p>He was aggrieved, deeply aggrieved; and he hated the hole and corner way
Mrs. Luke had hidden from him, refusing to see him, refusing any sort of
explanation, turning him down with a single letter, and not answering
when he wrote back.</p>

<p>He, who was very well aware that he was conferring everything, that he
was giving her a chance in a million, when he called was shown the door;
and all he had done for her, the affection he had bestowed, the gifts he
had lavished, were as though they had not been. In the sight of South
Winch and of his own household he was humiliated. But it went deeper
than that: he knew himself for kind, and no one wanted his kindness; he
knew himself for generous, and no one wanted his generosity either.
Naturally he was full of resentment; so full, that he hadn’t even gone
to his office regularly that week, but had hung about his house and
grounds instead, fault-finding.</p>

<p>Where he hung about most was that part of his plantations which abutted
on the meadow dividing Abergeldie<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_208">{208}</a></span> from Mrs. Luke; and wandering among
his conifers he could see, without himself being seen, anything that
went on in her miserable plot of ground. If he had been told that such
behaviour was undignified he would have replied that dignity be damned;
for not only was he smarting under Mrs. Luke’s ingratitude, not only was
he annoyed beyond measure at not going to get the wife he no longer
really wanted&mdash;who would wish to be tied up to a jealous, middle-aged
woman, when there were so many pretty, cheerful girls about?&mdash;but he
longed, with a simple longing he hadn’t felt since he first went
sweethearting as a boy, to see Sally again.</p>

<p>He did see her; always, however, arm in arm with Hell’s Fury, as he now
called her who had so recently been his Marge. Then, on this Wednesday
afternoon, more than a week after Mrs. Luke had shown herself in her
true colours&mdash;a jolly good thing he had found her out before and not
after marriage, thought Mr. Thorpe, who yet was enraged that he had,&mdash;as
he wandered among his conifers after luncheon, nursing his grievances
and glancing every now and then at the little house across the meadow,
so insignificant and cheap and nevertheless able to play such a part in
his life, he saw young beauty at last come out alone, and go round to
the back of the tool-shed, and behave as has been indicated.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Mr. Thorpe stayed where he was, in case the H.F.&mdash;so,
for convenience sake, did he abbreviate the rude nickname he had given
Mrs. Luke&mdash;should come out too; but when some time had passed and nobody
appeared, he concluded that the two high-brows had gone for a walk, and
Beauty for once was alone. Crying, too. What had they been doing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_209">{209}</a></span> the
girl, that precious pair of hoity toity treat-you-as-dirters, Mr. Thorpe
asked himself. Then, climbing cautiously over the fence, and crossing
the field close to the belt of firs, he arrived unseen and unheard to
where Sally, her head bowed over her hands, was standing crying.</p>

<p>How kind he was. What a comfort he was. And how clear in his
instructions as to what she was to do. It was quite easy to say things
to Father-in-law; he seemed to understand at once.</p>

<p>Nobody had told Sally he wasn’t her father-in-law. The Lukes’ habit of
silence towards her about their affairs had left her supposing he was
what he said he was, and she herself had heard him not being
contradicted by Mrs. Luke when she came into the drawing-room that day
and he told her he was making friends with his new daughter.</p>

<p>Sally was aware that Jocelyn’s own father was dead, and she had at first
supposed Mr. Thorpe was Mrs. Luke’s second husband. In the confusion of
mind in which she had been since arriving at Almond Tree Cottage, she
had had no thoughts left over for wondering why, if he were, he lived
somewhere else. Dimly the last few days, not having seen him again, she
had begun to think, though with no real interest, that perhaps Mrs. Luke
hadn’t quite married him yet, but only very nearly. Anyhow it didn’t
matter. He said he was her father-in-law, and that was good enough for
her. Such a kind old gentleman. Much older than her own father. Might
easily have been her grandfather, with all that bald head and grey
moustache.</p>

<p>And Mr. Thorpe’s pleasure, nay, delight, at being able to help Beauty
and at the same time give those two<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_210">{210}</a></span> high-brows something to talk about,
was very great. This was indeed killing two birds with one stone&mdash;and
what birds! He listened attentively to all she brokenly and imperfectly
said; he entirely applauded her idea of going back to her father for a
bit, and assured her there was no place like home; he told her he would
send her there in one of his cars, quite safe from door to door; he
advised her to stay with her father till her husband did his duty, which
was to make a home for her and live with her in it; he asked why she
should allow herself to be deserted, to be left alone with Mrs. Luke,
who would do nothing but try and cram her head with rubbish&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Don’t you like ‘er?’ asked Sally, surprised.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Mr. Thorpe stoutly.</p>

<p>‘But you’re goin’ to marry ‘er,’ said Sally, more surprised.</p>

<p>‘Catch <i>me</i>,’ said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘But then you ain’t my father-in-law,’ said Sally, more surprised than
ever.</p>

<p>‘Yes I am,’ said Mr. Thorpe hastily. ‘Once a father-in-law always a
father-in-law,’ he assured her,&mdash;and hurried her off this subject by
asking her why she should be treated by her husband as if she weren’t
married at all, and by what right young Luke thought he could behave
differently from any husband any one had ever heard of. Scandalous, said
Mr. Thorpe, to leave her. Shocking. Incomprehensible. And that so-called
husband of hers with his marriage vows not yet had time to go cold on
his lips!</p>

<p>In fact, Mr. Thorpe said out loud and beautifully everything Sally had
thought and not been able to get into words.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_211">{211}</a></span></p>

<p>The result was that, encouraged and supported, indeed urged and driven,
she took one of those desperate steps characteristic of the very meek,
and, acting according to Mr. Thorpe’s clear and precise instructions,
stole out of the house at five next morning&mdash;the very day of the party,
from which he, who knew all about it from his housekeeper, and had tried
to console himself by thinking of the piles of strawberries and peaches
and quarts of cream he wasn’t going to send to it, insisted that she
should at all costs escape&mdash;carrying only a little bag, with her five
shillings in it and her comb and toothbrush; and, creeping down the
stairs holding her breath, got out without a sound through the kitchen
window, anxiously listening for a moment as she passed the shut
sitting-room door on the other side of which Jocelyn lay
asleep,&mdash;Jocelyn, who that night, being still much annoyed with her, had
very fortunately not been upstairs.</p>

<p>At the corner of the road was Mr. Thorpe’s car. He himself remained
discreetly in bed. No use overdoing things. Besides, he could wait. He
knew where to find Beauty when the time came, which was more than those
damned Lukes did; and he had given his chauffeur the necessary orders
the night before, and could rely on their being carried out to the
letter; so that Sally found, when she got into the car, which was more
splendid outside and more soft inside than she could have believed
possible, not only a lovely rug of the silkiest fur, which the
chauffeur, a most attentive young gentleman, wrapped round her legs as
carefully as if they were the Queen’s, but a basket full of everything
for breakfast, even hot coffee, and an enormous box of chocolates which
were for her to keep, the chauffeur said, with Mr. Thorpe’s compliments.
And such was the effect on her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_212">{212}</a></span> of all this moral and physical support
that she no longer, as she was smoothly and deliciously borne along
through sleeping South Winch, across awakening London, past sunshiny
fields and woods just flushing green, on and on, into Essex, into
Cambridgeshire, smooth and swift, with a motion utterly different from
the one Jocelyn’s car made and completely confidence-inspiring, she no
longer felt as if she were doing anything that was frightening, and
also, perhaps, wrong. Could anybody be doing anything very wrong who had
such a splendid car to sit in, and such a respectful and attentive young
gentleman driving it?</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Mr. Pinner disillusioned her.</p>

<p>For many years he hadn’t tasted such quiet happiness, such contentment
and well-being, as during the four weeks he had been without Sally. Her
marriage to a gentleman, to one of the scholars from Cambridge, was
known to every one in the village, and he was proud of it, very proud.
Sally, besides having been handed over safe and sound to some one else’s
care, had risen in life and was now a lady. He had every reason to be
proud of her, and no further bother. Now for the first time he could
live, after forty years of the other thing, free from females. Was it
sinful, he asked himself occasionally, and at variance with God’s Word,
to be so very happy all alone? He didn’t think it could be. He had
served his time. Forty years in the wilderness he had had&mdash;just like the
Israelites, who had come out of it too, just as he had, and enjoyed
themselves too at last, as he was enjoying himself, quietly and nicely.
No husband or father could have been fonder of his wife and daughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_213">{213}</a></span>
than he had been of his, or done his duty by them more steadily. Surely
now, both of them being safely settled, it couldn’t be wrong to like
having a rest? He loved Sally, but she had been a back-breaking
responsibility. For four weeks now he had enjoyed himself, and with such
relish that when he got up in the morning and thought of the quiet, free
hours ahead of him, he had often quavered into song. Then came the day
when, peacefully dusting the toffee in his window, and thinking how
prettily the birds were singing that fine spring morning, and of the
little bit of mutton he was going to do in capers for his dinner, he saw
an enormous closed car coming down the village street, and with
astonishment beheld it stop in front of his shop, and Sally get out.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner knew enough of what cars cost to be sure this one wasn’t
anyhow Mr. Luke’s. Things like that cost as much as two of Mr. Luke’s
five hundreds a year; so that the car, of which Sally had been so proud,
far from impressing him only frightened him. And when, after the
chauffeur had handed her a bag, he saw him turn the car round and
disappear, going away again without her while she came running up the
steps, he was more frightened than ever.</p>

<p>What had happened? Not a month married, and back again by herself with a
bag.</p>

<p>‘I come ’ome,’ said Sally in the doorway, still bright with the sheer
enjoyment of the ride, yet, faced by her father’s amazement, conscious
of a slight lowering of her temperature. ‘My! You ain’t ’alf small,
Father,’ she added, surprised, after looking at the tall Jocelyn and the
broad Mr. Thorpe, by how little there was of Mr. Pinner. ‘Almost count
you on the fingers of one ’and,’ she said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_214">{214}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Want more fingers than I got to count <i>you</i>,’ retorted Mr. Pinner,
retreating behind the counter and feeling that these words somehow
constituted a smart preliminary snub.</p>

<p>He didn’t offer to kiss her. He stood entrenched behind his counter and
stared up at her, struck, after having got out of the habit of her
beauty, into a new astonishment at it. But it gave him no pleasure. It
merely frightened him. For it blew up peace.</p>

<p>‘Where’s your ’usband?’ he inquired, afraid and stern.</p>

<p>‘Oh&mdash;<i>’im</i>,’ said Sally, trying to look unconcerned, but flushing. ’E’s
with ’is mother, ’e is. Ain’t you pleased to see me, Father?’ she asked,
in an attempt to lead the conversation off husbands at least for a bit;
and tighter to her side she hugged the box of chocolates, because the
feel of it helped her to remember Father-in-law’s approval and
encouragement. And he was a gentleman, wasn’t he? And a lot older even
than Father, so must know what was what.</p>

<p>‘Oh, indeed. With ’is mother, is ’e,’ said Mr. Pinner, ignoring her
question. ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Oos car was that?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Father-in-law’s,’ said Sally, hugging her chocolates.</p>

<p>‘Oh, indeed. And ’oo may father-in-law be?’</p>

<p>‘The gentleman as is&mdash;as was goin’ to marry Mr. Luke’s mother.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, indeed. And you ride about in ’is car meanwhile. <i>I</i> see.’</p>

<p>‘Lent it to me so I can come ’ome.’</p>

<p>‘What do ’e want to send you ’ere for, then?’ asked Mr. Pinner, leaning
on his knuckles, his blue eyes very bright. ‘Ain’t your ’ome where your
’usband’s is? Ain’t that a married woman’s ’ome?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_215">{215}</a></span>’</p>

<p>‘I only come on a visit,’ faltered Sally, whose spirits were by now in
her shoes. Her father had often scolded her, but she had never been
afraid of him. Now there was something in his eye that made her feel
less sure that she had taken, as Mr. Thorpe had told her, the one
possible and completely natural step. ‘I only come for a few days, while
Mr. Luke&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Luke know you’re ’ere?’ interrupted her father.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>E don’t know yet,’ said Sally. ‘But I&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘That’s enough,’ said Mr. Pinner, holding up a hand. ‘That’s quite
enough. No need for no more words. You go back right away to your
’usband, my girl. Come to the wrong box, you ’ave, for ’arbourin’
runaway wives.’</p>

<p>‘But, Father&mdash;’ she stammered, not yet quite able to believe that in
coming back to him she had only got out of the frying pan into the fire,
‘you got to listen to <i>why</i> I come&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>He held up his hand again, stopping her. He had no need to listen. He
could see for himself that she was a runaway wife, which was against
both man’s and God’s laws.</p>

<p>Sally, however, persisted. She put her bag down on the counter, behind
which he firmly remained, and facing him across it tried to give him an
idea of what had been happening to her, and what had been going to
happen to her much worse if she had stayed.</p>

<p>He refused to be given an idea of it. He turned a deaf ear to all
explanations. And he was merely scandalised when she said, crying by
this time, that she couldn’t, couldn’t be left alone with Mr. Luke’s
mother, for where a husband thinks fit to leave his wife, said Mr.
Pinner, always supposing it is respectable, there that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_216">{216}</a></span> wife must remain
till he fetches her. This he laid down to Sally as a law from which a
married woman departs at her peril, and he laid it down with all the
more emphasis, perhaps, because of knowing how unlikely it was that he
himself would ever have had the courage to enforce it in the case of
Mrs. Pinner, and that, if he had, how certain it was she wouldn’t have
stayed five minutes in any place he tried to leave her in.</p>

<p>Sally was in despair. What was she to do? The little shop looked like
paradise to her, a haven of peaceful bliss after the life she had led
since last she saw it. She cried and cried. She couldn’t believe that
her father, who had always been so kind really, wouldn’t let her stay
with him for the two days till Jocelyn got back to Cambridge.</p>

<p>But not even for one night would Mr. Pinner, who was secretly terrified
of Jocelyn, and sure he would be hot on his wife’s tracks and make a
scene and blame him if he gave her so much as an inch of encouragement,
harbour her. Back she should go by the very next train to her husband
and her duty; and the breaking of marriage vows, and the disregard of
the injunctions in the New Testament which had so much shocked her in
Jocelyn, were now thrown at her by Mr. Pinner, who accused her of
precisely these. Useless for Sally, clinging to the hope of somehow
being able to justify herself and be allowed to stay, to say through her
tears that the Gospel didn’t mention what a woman had to do but only
what a man had to, because to that Mr. Pinner replied that no Gospel
could be expected to mention everything, and that in any case, when it
came to sinning, the sexes couldn’t be kept apart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_217">{217}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>He walked her off to the little station three miles away. The bag the
respectful chauffeur had wanted to carry for her up those few steps she
now carried three miles herself.</p>

<p>‘Pity you was in such a ’urry to let that there car go,’ Mr. Pinner
remarked sarcastically, as they trudged almost in silence along the
lanes.</p>

<p>Sally gulped; delicately, because even her gulps were little
gulps,&mdash;gentle, delicate little things. She didn’t know what was to
become of her, she really didn’t. Go back to that dreadful house, and
arrive in the middle of the party? Face real wrath, real deserved wrath,
from those who even when they were being kind had terrified her? So
thoroughly had Mr. Pinner’s horror at what she had done cleared her mind
of Mr. Thorpe’s points of view that she felt she hadn’t a leg to stand
on, and would do anything, almost, sooner than, covered with shame, go
back to the anger of the Lukes. But what? What could she do except go
back? Yet if she had been miserable there while she was still good, how
was she going to bear it now that she had become wicked? She shuddered
to think of what Mrs. Luke would be like really angry&mdash;and Mr. Luke, who
had the right not to leave her alone even at night....</p>

<p>Sadly did Sally gulp from time to time, and every now and then emit a
faint sob, as she walked in silence that morning beside the adamant Mr.
Pinner to the branch-line station. She hadn’t been in the Woodles
district very long, but it seemed to her as she passed along its quiet
lanes that she loved every stick and stone of it. It was what she
understood. It was peace. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_218">{218}</a></span> home. Her father went with her as far
as Cambridge, so as to put her safely into the express to Liverpool
Street, and his instructions were, after buying her a first class
ticket&mdash;he felt that Mr. Luke would wish her to travel first class, and
it gave him a gloomy pride to buy it&mdash;that she was to take a taxi from
Liverpool Street, and go in it all the way to South Winch.</p>

<p>He then, with the ticket, gave her a pound note.</p>

<p>‘It can’t be more than ten miles out,’ said Mr. Pinner, who had never in
his life before squandered money, let alone a pound, on a taxi, but who
tried to console himself with the thought that it would have been well
spent if only it got Sally safe back to where she belonged; and though
he was depressed he was also proud, for it, too, gave him a kind of
sombre satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Been an expensive day for me, this,’ he said, gloomy, but proud.</p>

<p>Sally gulped.</p>

<p>He kept her in the waiting-room at the station till the last moment, for
she was attracting the usual too well-remembered attention, and beauty
in tears was even more conspicuous than beauty placid, and then he
hurried her along to the front of the train, and put her in a carriage
in which there was only one lady&mdash;a real lady, of course, thought Mr.
Pinner, anxiously taking stock of her, or she wouldn’t be travelling
first class.</p>

<p>‘Beg pardon, Madam,’ he said in his best behind-the-counter manner,
taking his hat off. ‘You goin’ to London by any chance?’</p>

<p>Seeing that the train didn’t stop till it got there, the lady couldn’t
say anything but yes; and then Mr. Pinner asked her if she would mind
keeping an eye on his daughter, who, though a married lady too&mdash;the
lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_219">{219}</a></span> made a little bow of acknowledgement of this tribute to her
evidently settled-down appearance, though she was, in fact, a
spinster&mdash;yet didn’t know her way about very well.</p>

<p>Then when the train began to move, and Sally’s face, as she leant out of
the window to say goodbye, was a study in despair, Mr. Pinner relented
enough to pat her tear-stained cheek, and running a few steps beside the
carriage bade her not take on any more.</p>

<p>‘What’s done’s done,’ he called out after the train, by way of cheering
her.</p>

<p>And Sally, dropping back into her corner, pulled out her handkerchief
and wept.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Yes. What was done was done true enough, she thought, mopping the tears
as they rolled down her face, including her having married Mr. Luke and
his mother; for she now regarded him and his mother as all of a piece.</p>

<p>The lady at the other end of the carriage, who, however hard she tried,
couldn’t take her eyes off her&mdash;and she did try very hard, for she hated
staring at grief&mdash;ventured after a while to repeat Mr. Pinner’s advice,
and suggested, though in more Luke-like language, that Sally shouldn’t
take on. Whereupon Sally, the voice being sympathetic and the face kind,
took on more than ever.</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>please</i> don’t,’ said the lady, much concerned, moving up to the
seat opposite her. Such liquefaction she had never seen, nor such
loveliness in spite of it. When she herself cried, which was very
rarely&mdash;what was the good?&mdash;she became a swollen thing of lumps.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_220">{220}</a></span> ‘You
mustn’t, really,’ she begged. ‘Your eyes&mdash;you simply mustn’t do anything
to hurt them. What is it? Can I help at all? I’d love to if I could&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>By the time they were rushing through Bishops Stortford Sally had told
her everything. Incoherent and sobbing at first, there was something
about this lady that comforted her into calmness. She wasn’t at all like
Mr. Thorpe, yet she took his sort of view, not Mr. Pinner’s, and was
even more sympathetic, and even more understanding. It really seemed,
from the questions she asked, as if she must know the Lukes personally.
She said she didn’t, when Sally inquired if this were so, and laughed.
She was very cheerful, and laughed several times, though she was so kind
and sorry about everything.</p>

<p>‘You can’t go back there today, anyhow,’ she said at last. ‘Not into the
middle of that party&mdash;&mdash;’ she laughed and shuddered, for Sally had
explained with a face of horror that nobody at all was going to be at
the party who wasn’t either a lady or a gentleman except herself. ‘You
shall come and stay with me for a few days till your Mr. Luke goes to
Cambridge, and then we’ll see what happens. But I’m not going to let you
go back into the clutches of that Mrs. Luke.’</p>

<p>And she leant forward and took her hand, and smiled so kindly and
cheerfully, and said, ‘You’ll come for a day or two to our house, won’t
you? My father isn’t there just now, and I’ve got it all to myself. Come
till we have made up our minds about what to do next.’</p>

<p>This really seemed too good to be true. Sally turned scarlet. Was she
saved? Saved, at the very last minute, from horror and disgrace?</p>

<p>‘Just for a day or two,’ said her new friend, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_221">{221}</a></span> couldn’t take her
eyes off Sally’s face, ’till your husband can find somewhere for you to
live. We’ll help him to look. I’ll come with you, and help to find
something. No, it doesn’t matter a bit about your not having any
luggage&mdash;I can lend you everything. And we’ll write to him if you like,
and tell him you can’t and won’t stay with his mother. Don’t you think
this is quite the best plan? Don’t you, Sally?’</p>

<p>And she smiled, and asked if she might call her Sally.</p>

<p>‘But,’ hesitated Sally, for she didn’t want to get anybody into
difficulties, ‘Father says I’m a runaway wife, and ’e wouldn’t ’arbour
me ’imself because of that.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but somebody must. And I’m the very one for it, because I’m so
respectable, and not a wife. Don’t you worry, you lovely thing. We
really must bring your Mr. Luke to his senses. By the way, hasn’t he got
a Christian name?’</p>

<p>‘You never ’<i>eard</i> such a name,’ said Sally earnestly, who felt, to her
own great surprise, almost as comfortable and easy with this strange
lady as she had with Mr. Soper. ‘Outlandish, I call it.’</p>

<p>Her new friend laughed again when she told her it was Jocelyn. ‘Aren’t
you delicious,’ she said, her bright eyes screwed up with laughter.</p>

<p>Sally liked being called delicious. It gave her assurance. Jocelyn had
called her lots of things like that in his red-eared moments, but they
hadn’t done her much good, because they never seemed to go on into next
day. This lady was quite in her ordinary senses, her ears were proper
pale ears, and what she said sounded as though it would last. And how
badly Sally needed reassurance after the things Mr. Pinner had said to
her that morning!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_222">{222}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Now you come along with me,’ said her friend, jumping up as the train
ran into Liverpool Street, her eyes, which were like little black
marbles, dancing. ‘And please call me Laura, will you? Because it’s my
name.’</p>

<p>She leaned out of the window, and waved. A chauffeur came running down
the platform and opened the door; a car was waiting; and in another
minute Sally was in it, once more sunk in softness, and once more with a
lovely fur rug over her knees, while sitting next to her, talking and
laughing, was her new friend, and sitting opposite her, neither talking
nor laughing, a smart young lady in black, carrying a bag, who had
appeared from nowhere and wasn’t taken any notice of, and who looked
steadily out of the window.</p>

<p>‘What a <i>day</i> I’m ’avin’, thought Sally.</p>

<p>But when presently the car stopped at a big house in a great square with
trees in the middle, and a footman appeared at the door, and in the hall
Sally could see another one just like him, and then another, and yet
another, she was definitely frightened.</p>

<p>‘Oh lor,’ she whispered, shrinking back into the car.</p>

<p>‘No&mdash;Laura,’ said her new friend, laughing and taking her hand; and
drawing it through her arm she led her up the steps of the house, and
into the middle of the first real fleshpots of her life.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Fleshpots.</p>

<p>She had thought her honeymoon was a honeymoon of fleshpots; she had been
sure Almond Tree Cottage was the very home of them; but now she saw the
real thing: fleshpots <i>in excelsis</i>.</p>

<p>Her father had said, ‘Beware of fleshpots,’ when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_223">{223}</a></span> was expounding the
doings of the Children of Israel to her of a Sunday afternoon, ‘they
don’t do no one no good.’ And she had been brought up so carefully, so
piously, so privately, that she had never come across that literature of
luxury, those epics of fat things, that are lavishly provided for the
poor and skimped. The flunkeys and the frocks, the country castles and
the town palaces, the food, the jewels and the dukes, had remained
outside her imaginative experience. What she had read had been her
Bible, and a few books of her mother’s childhood in which people were
sad, and good and ill, and died saying things that made her cry very
much. There was nothing to set her dreaming in these. Life, she thought,
was like that, except for the lucky ones such as herself, who had kind
parents and a nice back parlour to sit and sew in when their work was
done. There were the gentry, of course; they existed, she knew, but only
knew vaguely. Entirely vague they had been in her mind till she became a
Luke, and found herself engulfed by them; and what an awe-inspiring
engulfing it had seemed to her, with Ammond handing round everything at
meals, and tea on a table you didn’t sit up at!</p>

<p>Now, as her new friend’s arm propelled her past the blank-faced footmen,
across the great marble-floored and columned hall, she realised that
Almond Tree Cottage had been the merest wheelbarrow in size and fittings
compared to this. This was grand. More&mdash;this was terrible. It was her
idea of a cathedral or a museum, but not of a place human beings washed
their hands in, and talked out loud.</p>

<p>‘P’raps,’ she murmured to the lady called Laura, holding back as she was
about to be taken into a room<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_224">{224}</a></span> which she could see at once she would
never feel comfortable in, and where far away in the distance was
another of those tables with tea on it that one didn’t sit up at,
‘p’raps, if you don’t mind, I’d better be gettin’ along after all&mdash;&mdash;’
for, being polite, she had forced herself to bow with a nervous smile to
a gentleman in black, who was standing about and whose eye had met hers,
and he hadn’t taken any notice but looked as blank-faced as everybody
else, and the rebuff had terribly embarrassed her.</p>

<p>‘Come along,’ was all Laura said to that, calling out over her shoulder
to the same gentleman in black to see that a room was got ready for Mrs.
Luke; and he answered, as polite and mild as milk, ‘Very good,
m’lady&mdash;&mdash;’ so he was a servant, and Laura was one of those ladies
Sally had heard her parents sometimes allude to with awe, who are always
being told they’re ladies every time any one speaks to them, and who
were, so Mr. and Mrs. Pinner declared, the pick of the basket.</p>

<p>‘P’raps,’ murmured Sally again, faintly, for the thought of having got
among the pick of the basket unnerved her, ‘I’d best do what Father
said, and take a taxi....’</p>

<p>‘You shall if you really want to,’ said Laura, ‘but let’s have tea
first. And think of that party! It’s raging at this minute. Oh,
Sally&mdash;could you bear it?’</p>

<p>Sally sat down on the chair Laura pushed up for her. She sat down
obediently, but only on the edge of it, her long slender legs tucked
sideways, as one sits who isn’t at ease. No, she couldn’t bear to go
back to that party; nor could she, waiting till it was over, go back
after it and face Mrs. Luke. It was more than flesh and blood could
manage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_225">{225}</a></span></p>

<p>Then, that being so, and seeing that her father wouldn’t have her, the
only thing to do was to stay where she was till Usband went to Cambridge
on Saturday, and be thankful she had this kind lady to be with, and try
and swallow all the servants and marble, and do her best to behave
grateful. It was only for a couple of days, for directly Usband got to
Cambridge she would go after him as a wife should. Fallen on her feet
wonderfully she had, Sally anxiously assured herself; but nevertheless,
as she sat on the edge of her chair, and great pictures looked down at
her from vast walls, she felt excessively uneasy.</p>

<p>‘Tell me some more about the Lukes,’ said Laura gaily, arranging a
little table in front of her on which her cup and plate had a nice lot
of room, and nothing got spilt or dropped. ‘I think they’re such fun.’</p>

<p>‘Fun?’ echoed Sally, her lips parting.</p>

<p>She stared at Laura. Fun? The Lukes?</p>

<p>‘I never ’eard of a ’usband bein’ fun,’ she said in a very low voice,
her head drooping.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps that isn’t quite the word,’ said Laura, ‘though I believe it’s
a very good way of approaching them.’ And then she paused, teapot in
hand, her eyes on Sally’s face. ‘I suppose,’ she said, ‘you know you’re
the most utterly beautiful thing?’</p>

<p>Whereupon Sally started, for this was the way Mrs. Luke had begun with
her, and said quickly, even as she had said then, ‘But I can’t ’elp it.’</p>

<p>‘Help it?’ echoed Laura, astonished.</p>

<p>‘People begins,’ said Sally anxiously, ‘with “Oh my, ain’t you
beautiful,” and ends with bein’ angry. It ain’t as if I could ’<i>elp</i>
it,’ she said, looking up at her new friend with eyes in which tears
were gathering, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_226">{226}</a></span> it would be more than she could bear on her empty
stomach&mdash;she had had no food since her breakfast in Mr. Thorpe’s car&mdash;if
she too were going to be angry with her.</p>

<p>Really such an extraordinary piece of good fortune as this had never yet
come Laura’s way.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Now was Sally shovelled up by chance from the bottom of the social
ladder to the top, for Laura was the spinster daughter of a duke. He was
so aged that, by sheer going on living, everything he had ever done,
good and bad, had been forgotten, and at last he had become an object of
universal respect. Ninety-three next birthday; a great age. And his
eldest son, the prospective duke, was sixty-five,&mdash;a great age too for
anything that is still prospective. He was a marquis, Sally learned with
surprise presently, when she was having her tea and Laura, who perceived
she needed soothing, was trying to distract her by telling her about her
relations; for she failed to understand why he shouldn’t be a duke.
Pinners produced Pinners; why not dukes dukes?</p>

<p>But Laura said these things couldn’t be explained, and hurried on.</p>

<p>The old duke had married three times, and Laura was the product of what
the neat-phrased French would call the third bed. All the beds, first,
second, and third, had long vanished, and of the third, which had been
very fruitful, Laura, and her brother Charles, and her married sister
Terry, were the only surviving traces. The second bed had been barren;
the first had provided the heir, and three ancient ladies old enough to
be Laur<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_227">{227}</a></span>a’s mothers, who were scattered over England in varying degrees
of resignation, one being the widow of a bishop, another the widow of a
Cabinet Minister, and the third not yet the widow of a club man and
expert bridge-player, who never came home till next day.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t ’e?’ asked Sally, manners seeming to demand that she should
say something when, for an instant, her friend paused.</p>

<p>But Laura said these things couldn’t be explained, and hurried on.</p>

<p>Much the liveliest of the beds had been the one she herself came out of,
and her blood pressure&mdash;except during the last year of the War, when
unceasing hard work, combined with a diet of practically continual
boiled fish, reduced it to a comfortable normal&mdash;had always been higher
than was convenient. This led her into excesses. She must be up and
doing; she found it impossible to sit still. Vitality bubbled in her
quick speech and danced in her black eyes. She was now thirty-five,
round and stubby, fleet of foot and swift of reply, and her past was
strewn with charities she had organised, dressmakers she had
established, hat shops she had run, estate agencies she had started,
hospital beds she had endowed, arts she had supported, geniuses she had
discovered, and four lovers.</p>

<p>Four weren’t many, she thought, considering the piles her sister Terry
had got through. Laura’s lovers had come and gone, as lovers do, and she
hadn’t minded much, because neither had they. There was something too
electric about her for love. She seemed to crackle in their very arms.
This disconcerted them; and each in his turn married some one else.</p>

<p>For a long time now she had been bored, and bored<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_228">{228}</a></span> violently, and by the
time she came across Sally she had seen everything, been everything,
heard everything and done everything; and the prospect of seeing and
being and hearing and doing over and over again, till her joints cracked
and her hair fell out, was boring her into fits.</p>

<p>Her father’s three wives had been the daughters of millionaires, whose
pride it was to leave them all their money. Her father, rich before, had
thus become incredibly richer. England was full of him. And the war had
only made him richer, because he owned coal mines. Such riches, Laura
considered, were disgusting, and she had plunged into Socialism, and
come up dripping Labour. But whatever she did, whatever she was, her
chief job was to look after her father, and see that his last years were
peaceful; and she had now only left him in Cambridgeshire, where they
had been spending Easter, for a day or two, and rushed up to London
because of being obliged to go to a charity ball of which she was a
patroness, to the first night of a play whose author she was
encouraging, to a bazaar in aid of the Black and Blue League, of which
she was vice-president and whose aims were the assistance of wives, and,
if possible, to look in at a concert being given by a young violinist
she had helped to have trained: and she had been thinking, as she sat in
the empty railway carriage between Crippenham and Cambridge&mdash;the
expresses stopped at Crippenham when the Duke was in residence&mdash;that all
this was a great bore.</p>

<p>What was the good of it, really? Oughtn’t charity to be approached quite
differently? Weren’t bazaars essentially vicious? Did wives need
assistance more than husbands? And there was her own stupid supper-party
that night after the play, with the author coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_229">{229}</a></span> to it, and the
leading lady, and Streatley her elder brother, who thought he admired
the leading lady, and Terry her sister, who thought the author admired
her, and Charles her younger brother, who was sure he admired nobody,
and one or two others, including a dramatic critic; and how too
perfectly awful if the play was a failure, and there they all were,
boxed up with the person who had written it.</p>

<p>‘Silly life,’ she had been thinking as the train ran into Cambridge.
‘Round and round in a cage we go, and nothing is ever different except
our whiskers, which keep on getting greyer.’</p>

<p>‘But then,’ she said leaning forward, her eyes twinkling and dancing as
she looked at Sally, who by this time had finished her tea, ‘the door
opened and you got in. Too marvellous, Sally. Divinely beautiful. And
not an h in your whole delicious composition.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon?’ said Sally, who hadn’t quite got that.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>She hadn’t understood more than a word here and there of all the words
Laura had rattled off at her, and in her heart, while she steadily ate
sandwiches, she had slowly come to the conclusion that the pick of the
basket was a queer fish. An affectionate and friendly fish, but queer
all right, thought Sally; and in spite of the good tea&mdash;the best she had
ever had, outdoing the one at Truro, and infinitely better than any at
Mrs. Luke’s,&mdash;in spite of the calming and balancing effect of
nourishment after not having had a bite to eat since five o’clock that
morning, in spite of Laura’s kindness and cheerfulness, Sally felt
uneasy.</p>

<p>She oughtn’t to be there. She oughtn’t to have come<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_230">{230}</a></span> with Laura. It was
only for two days, but two days were enough to do wrong in. What would
her father say, who thought she was at that moment in a taxi, paid for
by his pound, if he could see her? What would Mrs. Luke say? What was
Mrs. Luke saying, anyhow? As for Mr. Luke, what he would say didn’t so
much matter, because almost before he had finished saying it she would
have joined him in Cambridge, and started acting as a wife should. Of
course he on his side must act as a husband should, and not try and send
her away from him to his mother,&mdash;that was only fair, wasn’t it? Sally
anxiously asked herself.</p>

<p>And her uneasiness became acute when Laura, having taken her up a whole
lot of stairs, every one of which looked like pure marble, and into a
room she could only guess was a bedroom because there was a bed in it,
but which was otherwise unidentifiable to Sally as such, sat down at a
table and began telephoning to people to send round somebody at once
with dresses and shoes to be tried on a young lady, who had to wear them
that very evening.</p>

<p>Sally listened in alarm. Impossible not to guess that she was the young
lady; impossible not to gather that there was to be a party, and she was
to be at it. Had she after all only escaped Mrs. Luke’s party to find
herself caught in another? Was Laura, who had so much sympathised with
her earnest wish not to be present at the one, going to plunge her into
the other?</p>

<p>Standing afraid and conscience-stricken in front of the blazing wood
fire, while Laura telephoned&mdash;this all came of not obeying her
father&mdash;Sally wondered whether anything could save her. Laura had saved
her from Mrs. Luke, but who was going to save her from Laura?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_231">{231}</a></span> Laura
lived in the middle of marble. She had servants at her beck and call,
and could make the gentleman in black do anything she chose. And the
smart young lady, who had sat on the small seat of the car and looked
out of the window, presently, on Laura’s telling her to, crawled round
the floor at Sally’s feet with her mouth full of pins, doing something
to a petticoat of Laura’s that Sally, it seemed, was going to have to
wear that evening.</p>

<p>‘All you’ve got to do, Sally,’ said Laura, having finished telephoning,
and coming briskly over to where her newest discovery was standing
meekly without her frock and hat, while the petticoat was pinned
narrower, ’is to enjoy yourself. Oh, you lovely, <i>lovely</i> thing!’ she
burst out, beating her hands together with delight; for the more one
took off Sally the more exquisite she became.</p>

<p>Enjoy herself? She, a married woman? ‘Wonder ’ow,’ thought Sally.</p>

<p>‘Say what you like, do what you like,’ said Laura, her eyes bulging with
admiration, ‘and don’t care about anybody or anything. Don’t you bother
about h’s, or silly things like that. Just say whatever comes into your
darling, delicious head, and enjoy yourself.’</p>

<p>In the presence of the young lady crawling on the floor, Sally was dumb.
Laura, on the other hand, talked just as if she weren’t there; but when
for a moment Sally found herself alone with Laura, she did make a mild
protest.</p>

<p>‘Might ’ave gone back to that there other party after all,’ she said,
’an’ done what Father tell me, if I got to be at one any’ow.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but this isn’t a party,’ Laura hastily assured her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_232">{232}</a></span> for Sally was
distinctly drooping. ‘This is a theatre. You like going to a play, don’t
you, Sally? Of course you do. I simply don’t believe the girl exists who
doesn’t.’</p>

<p>Yes; Sally liked going to a play. She hadn’t ever been to one, and the
idea of a theatre did cheer her up. And Laura said nothing about the
supper afterwards, because why say everything?</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>They went, then, to the first night of Mr. Gillespie’s new play. Sally
was astonished when Laura, and the maid, and the head lady from
Paquille’s and her two assistants, had finished with her and bade her
look at herself in the glass.</p>

<p>‘That me?’ she asked, her lips parting and her eyes widening, for it
might have been a real grand lady. And she added doubtfully, ‘I ain’t
’alf bare.’</p>

<p>Laura, however, was just as bare, and there was ever so much more of her
to be bare with, so she supposed it must be all right; but she did
wonder what her father would say if he could see her now&mdash;‘Oh, my
<i>goodness</i>,’ shuddered Sally, her mind slinking away from the thought.</p>

<p>They had dressed her in a cloud of blue tulle over a cloud of green
tulle. Her loveliness was startling. It was like nothing either Laura or
the lady from Paquille’s had ever seen, and they had seen most of what
there was of existing beauty. Even the maid, an expert in repression,
showed excitement. And presently when the Paquille lady wrapped the
cloak round her that went with that frock, and, swathed in its green and
silver, she looked like a white flower in a slender sheath of green,
Laura fairly danced with delight to think what Terry<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_233">{233}</a></span> would say, who was
used to being so much prettier than anybody else, and what Charles would
say, who long had declared there was no such thing as real beauty, and
Streatley, who said the women nowadays couldn’t hold a candle to the
women of his youth, and everybody.</p>

<p>Such a find, such a haul, such a piece of luck had never yet befallen
Laura. And the mischievous pleasure she took in thinking of the effect
it was going to have on her relations and of the upsetting results it
was going to produce, was all the more surprising because, at the bottom
of her heart, she was devoted to them.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Among the opera-glasses that raked Sally as she followed Laura into the
stage box three minutes before the curtain went up on Mr. Gillespie’s
new play, were Terry’s. She was in the stalls, with the young man who
just then was, as the Pinners would have said, walking out with her. He
too was looking at Sally.</p>

<p>‘Laura’s latest,’ remarked Terry, turning to him after a prolonged
incredulous stare at the astonishing contents of the box; for Laura was
well known for her successive discoveries of every kind&mdash;saints,
geniuses, rugged men of labour&mdash;each of which, after a brief blare of
publicity, disappeared and was not heard of again.</p>

<p>The young man’s face, however, had the kind of expression on it as he
looked at Sally that is apt to annoy the woman one is with; and Terry,
who was strictly monogamous during each of her affairs, and expected the
other person to be so too, didn’t like it.</p>

<p>‘Who is she?’ asked her young friend.</p>

<p>‘God knows,’ said Terry, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>The curtain went up and the lights went down, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_234">{234}</a></span> Sally disappeared
into the darkness. When next she was visible, Charles Moulsford and Lord
Streatley had joined their sister in the box. They were talking to
Sally. She was politely smiling. The house had eyes for nothing else.</p>

<p>‘Who <i>is</i> she?’ asked Terry’s young friend again, with a warmer
insistence.</p>

<p>‘You’d better go and ask her,’ said Terry, cross.</p>

<p>‘All right, I will,’ said her young friend; and got up and left her; for
by this time she had been monogamous with him for six months, and he
long had wished she would love him less.</p>

<p>The other three acts of the play took place in bright summer weather,
and the glorious sunshine on the stage lit up Sally too in the stage
box. The house had eyes only for her. Mr. Gillespie’s play accordingly
fell flat. Nobody called for him at the end, what applause there was was
absent-minded, and next morning the leading newspaper, after a
perfunctory <i>résumé</i> of that which it unkindly described as the alleged
plot, ended by remarking languidly, ‘Mr. Gillespie must try again.’</p>

<p>It was a strange evening. The actors, who began well, seemed to get more
and more bloodless as the play proceeded. Mr. Gillespie, crouching in
the darkest corner of the box above Laura’s, a shelter out of which
nothing would have dragged him except the most frenzied cries of
enthusiasm, couldn’t imagine what was the matter with his players; but
they had felt almost at once that no notice was being taken of them, and
presently, discovering the reason, a blight settled on them, and its
ravages, as the evening went on, became more marked. By the end there
was practically complete anaemia, and Mr. Gillespie, fleeing from the
theatre before the final curtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_235">{235}</a></span> so as to see and hear nothing more, so
as to get away, so as to meet neither managers nor actors, so as to wipe
from his mind that he had ever written plays, or ever hoped, or ever
believed, or ever had dreams and ambitions, went straight for comfort to
his friend Lady Laura Moulsford, who had been so kind and encouraging,
and who had told him to come round to her that evening, laughingly
promising to have the laurels ready.</p>

<p>Laurels! Poor Mr. Gillespie now only wanted to hide his head in her kind
lap. He winced to remember how happily he too had laughed, how sure he
had been. But that was because of the great success of his first play;
and this one, his second, was twenty times better, and was going to be
twenty times greater a success.</p>

<p>And so it would have been except for Sally. When, presently, after he
had waited three quarters of an hour alone in the library at Goring
House because Sally was being so much crowded round coming out of the
theatre that it took all that time to extricate her and get her away,
she came in with Laura and Laura’s brothers, he instantly realised what
had happened; and even as Mr. Soper hadn’t grudged her his stew, though
feeling aggrieved, so did Mr. Gillespie, though feeling heartbroken, not
grudge her the laurels that should have been his.</p>

<p>He turned very red; he bent low over her hand when Laura introduced him;
he murmured, ‘I lay my failure at your feet and glory in it,’&mdash;this
being the way Mr. Gillespie talked; and Sally, nervous and bewildered,
but indomitably polite, said, ‘Pardon?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_236">{236}</a></span>’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>She kept on saying ‘Pardon?’ that evening. She found it difficult to
follow the things they all said. They were kind, and seemed to want to
make her happy, but their language was obscure. So was Mr. Luke’s, if it
came to that, only he, except at intervals, wasn’t kind. No, she
couldn’t call Mr. Luke a kind man; but then he was her husband, and
these weren’t, though they all behaved, she thought, rather as if they
would like to be,&mdash;that is, there were curious and unmistakable
resemblances between their way of looking at her and speaking to her and
Jocelyn’s when he was courting. Lords, too, two of them. Who would have
thought lords would forget themselves like this? For they knew she was
married, and that it was sheer sin to look at her as though they were
going to be husbands. And they so grand and good in the newspapers,
making speeches, and opening hospitals! Sally was much shocked. One of
them was very old; he couldn’t, she decided, be far off his dying
breath. Oughtn’t he to be thinking what he was going to do about it,
instead of sitting up late at a party behaving as if he would like to be
a husband?</p>

<p>The only thing that comforted her for being at a party after all was
that Jocelyn wasn’t there. She felt she could manage parties much best
single-handed, without him watching and being angry. None of these
people were angry, or minded about how she spoke; on the contrary, they
seemed to like it, and laughed,&mdash;except one, the younger lord, who sat
as grave as a church. There was, when all was said and done, a certain
feeling of space in being without one’s husband; and after she<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_237">{237}</a></span> had
drunk a little champagne,&mdash;a very little, because it was so nasty, and
reminded her of fizzy lemonade gone bad&mdash;this feeling of space
increased, and she was able to listen to the things the gentlemen kept
on saying to her with the same mild patience, tinged with regret, with
which on her one visit to the Zoo she had contemplated the behaviour of
the monkeys. Laura’s relations seemed to Sally, as she sat listening to
them, as difficult to account for as the monkeys. One couldn’t account
for them. But even as these, she reminded herself, they belonged to God.</p>

<p>‘They’re God’s,’ Mr. Pinner had said that day at the Zoo, when asked by
her to explain why the monkeys behaved in the way they did; and that
being so there was nothing further to worry about.</p>

<p>As for Laura, whose heart, being a Moulsford’s, was good, though it
sometimes in moments of excitement forgot to be, she had several qualms
during that evening, and soon began to think that perhaps she oughtn’t
to have kidnapped Sally, or, having kidnapped her, ought to have kept
her hidden till she took her to Cambridge and handed her over to her
husband.</p>

<p>Yet she was even more of an overwhelming success than Laura had
expected. Streatley was idiotic about her, Charles had fallen in love at
last, Mr. Gillespie worshipped and forgave, the dramatic critic was
fatuous, Terry was indignant, and the leading lady had been so furious
when she saw Sally in the box, and knew why she herself and the play
were being failures, that she had refused to come round to supper.</p>

<p>‘What a success,’ thought Laura, looking round her table, the vacant
place at which was filled by Lady Streatley, who had drifted in
unexpectedly because<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_238">{238}</a></span> she didn’t see why Streatley should make a fool of
himself with that actress woman unchecked. She had come to check him,
and found him needing checking at an entirely different pair of feet.
‘What a <i>success</i>,’ thought Laura, suddenly ashamed.</p>

<p>‘And so you ought to be,’ said her brother Charles after supper, when
she&mdash;they were great friends&mdash;took him aside and told him she somehow
felt ashamed. ‘You’re a little fool, Laura, and never see further than
the end of your silly nose. I should get rid of a few of your good
intentions if I were you.’</p>

<p>‘But she was so unhappy,’ said Laura, trying to justify herself.</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t have cared in the very least if she had been plain,’ said
Charles.</p>

<p>‘Am I as bad as all that?’ asked Laura.</p>

<p>‘Every bit,’ said Charles, who was annoyed because of the way Sally was
disturbing him.</p>

<p>Indeed, the way Sally was disturbing everybody was most unfortunate.
Here was a united and affectionate family, the three younger ones almost
filially devoted to their elder brother, all four of them with the
warmest hearts, which, though they led them into situations Terry’s
husband and Streatley’s wife might dislike, never for an instant dimmed
their fraternal affections and loyalties. Not one of them would
willingly have hurt the others. All were most goodnatured, doing what
they could to make everybody happy. Laura was really benevolent; Theresa
was really kind; Charles was really unselfish; and Streatley so really
affectionate that he could still, at sixty-five, love several women at
once, including his wife.</p>

<p>How annoying for Charles, for instance, who was so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_239">{239}</a></span> fond of his brother,
and had looked on with bland detachment at his successive infatuations,
suddenly to find he was competing with him. Competing with Streatley!
And not only competing, but saying to himself that he was an ancient
ass. Charles was horrified to find himself thinking Streatley an ancient
ass; but he was even more horrified when he quite soon afterwards
discovered he was definitely desirous of strangling him. That was
because of the way he looked at Sally. It made Charles’s hitherto
affectionate fingers itch to strangle him.</p>

<p>And how annoying for Lady Streatley to see her elderly husband making
yet another fool of himself. He had made so many fools of himself over
women that it was to be supposed she would by now have got used to it.
Not at all. She was each time as profoundly upset as ever. And this time
it was really dreadful, because the girl was hardly more than a child.
Oughtn’t he to be thoroughly ashamed of himself?</p>

<p>‘I wish you could see the expression on your face,’ she murmured acidly
to him, as they got up from the supper-table and gathered round the
fire.</p>

<p>‘Leave my face alone,’ he growled, looking at her furiously; and that
she should be acid and he should growl and look at her furiously was
distressing to Lady Streatley, who was the most amiable of women, and
knew that he was the most naturally kind of men.</p>

<p>And then Terry, so affectionate and faithful to her young friend
Robert,&mdash;for her to have to look on while he forgot her very existence
and sat on the floor at somebody else’s feet, his rapt gaze fixed
unswervingly on a face that wasn’t hers, was most annoying. He had
insisted on coming round with her to Laura’s party,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_240">{240}</a></span> though she refused
at first to bring him. So violently determined was he, however, that he
assured her she would never see him again if she didn’t take him round
with her; and Terry, cowed, as many a fond woman had been before her by
this threat, gave in, and spent the evening in a condition of high
indignation.</p>

<p>It was Laura, though, with whom she was indignant,&mdash;Laura, the sister
she had always so much loved, who had arranged the whole thing so as to
set everybody by the ears. She forgave Robert&mdash;they had got to the stage
when she was continually forgiving him, and he was continually hoping
she wouldn’t&mdash;for how could he help it if this artful young woman from
the slums laid herself out to beguile him? It was all Laura’s fault.
Terry couldn’t have believed her goodnatured sister had it in her to be
so wickedly mischievous. What devil had taken possession of her? First
dressing the girl up and spoiling poor Jack Gillespie’s play with her,
and then getting them all there to supper, so as to make fools of
them....</p>

<p>‘I hope you’re pleased with your detestable party,’ she said, leaning
against the chimney piece, staring in wrathful disgust at the circle
round Sally, who, glancing shyly and furtively every now and then at the
lovely dark lady dressed like a rose, thought she must surely be the
most beautiful lady in the whole world, but feeling, judged Sally, a bit
on the sick side that evening,&mdash;probably eaten something.</p>

<p>‘I’m not at all pleased,’ snapped Laura, ‘and I wish to goodness you’d
all go home.’</p>

<p>That, however, was exactly what they couldn’t bear to do. Hours passed,
and Laura’s party still went on. The men were unable to tear themselves
away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_241">{241}</a></span> Sally, whose every utterance&mdash;she said as little as possible,
but couldn’t avoid answering direct questions&mdash;filled them with fresh
delight, and the two women, Terry and her aggrieved sister-in-law, were
doggedly determined to stay as long as they did.</p>

<p>‘If she weren’t so lovely,’ murmured Lady Streatley to the indignant
Terry, when a roar of laughter, in which the loudest roar was
Streatley’s, succeeded something Sally, tired and bewildered, had said
in answer to a question, ‘I suppose they wouldn’t see anything at all in
that Cockney talk.’</p>

<p>‘They’d think it unendurable,’ said Terry shortly.</p>

<p>‘But you see,’ said Laura, who was cross with Terry, ‘she happens to be
the most beautiful thing any of us have ever seen.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I quite see she’s very beautiful,’ said poor Lady Streatley, who
had given Streatley seven children and was no longer the woman she was.</p>

<p>‘If one <i>likes</i> that sort of thing,’ said Terry, descending in her anger
to primitive woman.</p>

<p>‘Which one evidently does,’ said Laura maliciously, glancing at the
infatuated group.</p>

<p>‘Men are such fools,’ said Terry.</p>

<p>‘Babies,’ sighed Lady Streatley.</p>

<p>Only once did Charles, who was the greatest contrast to his brother,
being lean and brown and goodlooking and not much past thirty, besides
remaining grave on all the occasions that evening when his brother
laughed, for Charles was fastidious as well as sympathetic, and Sally’s
accent didn’t amuse him, and he hated to see her unwittingly amusing the
other four infatuated fools,&mdash;only once did he get her a moment to
himself, and then only for a minute or two, while there was some slight<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_242">{242}</a></span>
rearrangement of positions because of the bringing in of a tray of
drinks.</p>

<p>When he did, this was the conversation:</p>

<p>‘I believe,’ said Charles in a low voice, ‘you’re every bit as beautiful
inside as you are out.’</p>

<p>‘Me?’ said Sally with weary surprise&mdash;by this time she was deadly
tired&mdash;for she hadn’t thought of bodies as reversible. ‘Ain’t I all
pink?’</p>

<p>‘Pink?’ echoed Charles, not at first following. Then he said rather
hastily, being queasy and without Streatley’s robust ability to enjoy
anything, ‘I mean your spirit. It’s just as divinely beautiful as your
face. I’m sure it is. I’m sure you never have a thought that isn’t
lovely&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he went on to murmur&mdash;why on earth he should say these inanities he
couldn’t think, and was much annoyed to hear them coming out&mdash;that he
hoped her husband loved her as she deserved.</p>

<p>‘You never <i>see</i> such lovin’,’ said Sally earnestly, who didn’t mind
this one of the gentlemen as much as the others.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I can imagine it,’ said Charles, again hastily; and wanted to know
whether, then, her husband wouldn’t be excessively unhappy, not having
an idea where she was.</p>

<p>‘Dunno about un’appy,’ said Sally, knitting her brows a little&mdash;Charles
was deeply annoyed to discover how much he wished to kiss them&mdash;for she
hadn’t thought of unhappiness in connection with her brief and strictly
temporary withdrawal. ‘Angry’s more like it.’</p>

<p>‘Angry?’ said Charles, incredulously. ‘Angry with you?’</p>

<p>‘Gets angry a lot, Mr. Luke do,’ said Sally, bowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_243">{243}</a></span> her exquisite
little head in what Charles regarded as a lovely but misplaced
acquiescence. ‘Except,’ she added, anxious to be accurate, ‘when ’e
begins oh-Sallyin’.’</p>

<p>This ended the conversation. Charles couldn’t go on. He was queasy. He
didn’t need to ask what oh-Sallying was. He could guess. And, as he
shuddered, the desire he had to strangle Streatley was supplemented by a
desire to save Sally,&mdash;to seize and carry her off, out of reach of
indignities and profanities, and hide her away in some pure refuge of
which only he should have the key.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_244">{244}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">He</span> couldn’t, however, do that; but he could carry her off next day in
his car into the country for a few hours, away from London and the
advances Streatley would be sure to try to make, and everybody else
would be sure to try to make who should meet her if she stayed with
Laura.</p>

<p>Next day was Friday; and his chief, one of the leading lights of the
Cabinet, to whom he was the most devoted and enthusiastic of private
secretaries, was going away for the week-end. Charles would be free.
Walking up and down his room, unable to go to bed, he decided he would
drive his car himself round to his father’s house the first thing in the
morning, not taking the chauffeur, and get hold of Sally before anyone
else did. For one whole day he would be alone with her. One day. It
wasn’t much to take out of her life, just one day?</p>

<p>Charles was in love. How not be? He was in love from the first moment he
saw the radiant beauty in Laura’s box at the play, and his love had
survived, though it took on a tinge of distress, their brief
conversation. But it became a passion when she broke up Laura’s party at
last by suddenly tumbling off her chair in a faint and lying crumpled on
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_245">{245}</a></span> floor at his feet, her eyes shut and her mouth a little open, and
her hands flung out, palm upwards, in a queer defencelessness.</p>

<p>There had been a rush to help, and he had actually shoved Streatley away
with a vicious intention of really hurting him, so unendurable had it
been to him to think of those great hairy hands, besmirched by a hundred
love affairs, touching the child; and it was he who had picked her up
and carried her upstairs, followed by Laura, and laid her on her bed.</p>

<p>‘I’m <i>ashamed</i> of you,’ he had said to Laura under his breath as he
turned and walked out of the room, shocked at such brutal exploiting of
an exhausted child.</p>

<p>‘But so am I, so am I&mdash;&mdash;’ Laura had answered distractedly, running to
the bell and frantically ringing for her maid; and Sally lay on the bed
like a folded flower, thought Charles, stirred by passion into poetic
images, and at least for the moment safe in unconsciousness from the
screaming, tearing, grabbing world.</p>

<p>The next morning, then, when Laura came down punctually at nine o’clock
to breakfast&mdash;for however late she went to bed her restless vitality,
once it was broad daylight, prevented her being able to stay there,
which made her unpopular in country houses,&mdash;she found Charles in the
dining-room, standing with his back to the fire.</p>

<p>‘How much you must love me,’ she remarked sarcastically, being, after a
bad night, a little cross.</p>

<p>‘I don’t love you at all at this moment,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Then is it breakfast you want?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Can it be Sally?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_246">{246}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Fancy,’ said Laura; and poured herself out some coffee.</p>

<p>‘How is she?’ asked Charles after a pause, ignoring such silliness.</p>

<p>‘Oh, quite well,’ said Laura. ‘She was tired last night.’</p>

<p>‘Tired! I should think so,’ said Charles severely. ‘I’ve come to ask her
if she will let me take her into the country for the day. It’s my
intention to get her away from your crowd for a few hours.’</p>

<p>‘Rescue her, in fact,’ said Laura, munching, her back to him.</p>

<p>‘Exactly,’ said Charles, who was angry.</p>

<p>‘I expect Tom’&mdash;Tom was Lord Streatley&mdash;‘will be here soon, wanting to
rescue her too,’ remarked Laura, glancing out of the window to where she
could see Charles’s touring car standing, and no chauffeur. ‘<i>He</i> won’t
bring his chauffeur either. Have some?’ she asked, holding up the
coffee-pot.</p>

<p>‘Can’t you be a little beast when you give your mind to it,’ said
Charles.</p>

<p>‘Well, you scolded me last night because <i>I</i> had rescued her, and now
here you are&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Laura broke off, and hastily drank some coffee. She didn’t really want
to quarrel with Charles; she never had yet. In fact, till Sally appeared
on the scene she had never quarrelled with any of her family. Besides in
her heart, though she was cross that morning, not having slept well for
the first time for years because of being worried and
conscience-stricken and anxious, she was glad that Charles should take
Sally off her hands. She had so much to do that day, so many important
engagements; and if Sally went with her everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_247">{247}</a></span> would instantly be
upset, and if she left her at home she would be a prey to Streatley.
Other people wishing to prey on her could be kept out by a simple order
to the servants, but not her own brother. And Streatley, when he was
infatuated, was a gross creature, and there would be more trouble and
wretchedness for poor Kitty his wife, let alone God knowing what
mightn’t happen to Sally.</p>

<p>If Sally had to be with one or the other of them, Charles was far the
better; but what a very great pity it was, Laura thought as she
pretended to be absorbed in her breakfast, that she hadn’t let her go
back the day before to where she belonged. It wasn’t any sort of fun
quarrelling with her dearest brother Charles, and seeing him look as if
he hadn’t slept a wink. Besides, Sally was going to have a baby. At
least, so she had informed Laura during the night, basing her conviction
on the close resemblance between her behaviour in fainting, and her
subsequent behaviour when she came to in being violently sick, and the
behaviour of somebody called Mrs. Ooper, who had lived next door at
Islington, and every spring, for seven years running, had fainted just
like that and then been sick,&mdash;and sure as fate, Sally had told Laura in
a feeble murmur, there at Christmas in each of those seven years had
been another little baby.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> don’t want no doctor,’ she had whispered, putting out a cold hand
and catching at Laura’s arm when, dismayed at Sally’s sickness just as
they had at last been able to undress her and get her into bed, she was
running to the telephone to call hers up.</p>

<p>‘But, my darling,’ Laura had said, bending over her and smoothing back
the hair from her damp forehead<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_248">{248}</a></span> with quick, anxious movements, ‘he’ll
give you something to make you well again.’</p>

<p>‘No, ’e won’t,’ Sally had whispered, looking up at her with a faint,
proud smile, ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>cos I ain’t ill. <i>I</i> know wot’s ’appenin’ all right. It’s
a little baby.’</p>

<p>And then she had told Laura, who had to stoop down close to hear, about
Mrs. Ooper.</p>

<p>Well, Laura didn’t know much about babies before they were born, but she
was sure a person who was expecting any ought to be with her husband.
She couldn’t kidnap whole families; she hadn’t bargained for more than
one Luke. And during the few hours that remained of the night, after she
had seen Sally go off to sleep with an expression of beatitude on her
face, she had tossed about in her own bed in a fever of penitence.</p>

<p>When would she learn not to interfere? When would she learn to hang on
to her impulses, and resist sudden temptation? Up to then she had never
even tried to. And a vision of what Sally’s unfortunate young husband
must be feeling, and of course his mother too, who might be tiresome but
hadn’t deserved this, produced the most painful sensations in Laura’s
naturally benevolent heart.</p>

<p>She would make amends,&mdash;oh, she would make amends. She would take Sally
to Cambridge herself on Saturday, when she was through with her London
engagements, and find rooms for her, and explain everything to the young
man, and beg his pardon. Perhaps, too, she could tell him a little of
Sally’s fear of his mother, and perhaps she might be able to persuade
him not to let her live with them; for Laura had often noticed, though
each time, being a member of the Labour Party, with shame and regret,
that the persuasions of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_249">{249}</a></span> daughter of a duke are readily listened to.
But she didn’t want to make amends that day,&mdash;she was too busy; and she
couldn’t send a telegram, or anything like that, letting the Lukes know
where Sally was, because it would only bring them about her ears in
hordes, and she simply hadn’t time that day for hordes. Laura’s
intentions, that is, were admirable, but deferred.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t she coming down?’ asked Charles at last, for Laura, with her back
to him pretending to eat her breakfast, had said no more.</p>

<p>‘She’s having breakfast upstairs,’ said Laura.</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you tell me?’ he asked, annoyed.</p>

<p>‘Because you say I’m a little beast, so I may as well do the thing
thoroughly.’</p>

<p>Charles went across to the bell.</p>

<p>‘No&mdash;don’t ring,’ said Laura jumping up. ‘I’ll go and tell her.’ And she
went to the door, but hesitated, and came back to him, and laid her hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>He withdrew his arm.</p>

<p>‘Charles&mdash;are you so angry with me?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘You’ve behaved simply disgracefully,’ he answered in a voice of deep
disgust. ‘You would sacrifice anybody to provide your friends with a new
sensation.’</p>

<p>Laura looked at him. It was true; or had been true. But she wasn’t going
to ever any more, she was going to turn over a new leaf&mdash;next day, when
she had finished with all her tiresome and important engagements.</p>

<p>‘You sacrificed that child’&mdash;began Charles, passionately indignant when
he thought of the unconscious figure on the floor.</p>

<p>‘Don’t <i>you</i> sacrifice her,’ interrupted Laura. And when Charles stared
at her, too angry for speech, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_250">{250}</a></span> added hastily, ‘Oh, don’t let’s
quarrel, Charles darling. I’m sure you’ll take the greatest care of her.
I’ll go and fetch her. Drive slowly, won’t you&mdash;and bring her back safe.
Tomorrow I’m going to hand her over to her husband.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Now in his heart Charles knew that this was the only right thing to do.
Sally ought never to have been taken away from her husband, and, having
been taken, ought to be returned to him. At once. Not tomorrow, but at
once. He didn’t know the circumstances, except what Laura had hurriedly
told him the night before after supper, about having found her in a
train, dissolved in tears because her father was sending her back to a
mother-in-law who was awful to her, and she had brought her home with
her just to comfort her, just to let her recover; but it was plain that
such conduct on Laura’s part was indefensible. If ever anybody ought to
be safe at home it was Sally. She should be taken there without losing a
moment. Disgraceful of Laura to put it off for another day and night,
while she kept her fool engagements. Having behaved so wickedly, she
ought, without losing an hour, to set things straight again.</p>

<p>Charles felt strongly about Laura’s conduct; yet, though he himself
could have set things straight by simply driving Sally back to the Lukes
that morning, he didn’t do so. That was because he couldn’t. He was in
love, and therefore couldn’t.</p>

<p>There are some things it is impossible to do when you are in love,
thought Charles, who recognised and admitted his condition, and one is
to hand over the beloved to a brute. Luke was a brute. Clearly he was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_251">{251}</a></span>
from what Sally had said the night before. He was either angry&mdash;angry
with that little angel!&mdash;or he oh-Sallied. A cold shudder ran down
Charles’s spine. The thought made him feel really sick, for he was a
tender-stomached as well as a tender-hearted young man, and possessed an
imagination which was sometimes too lively for comfort. It wouldn’t be
<i>his</i> hand that delivered her up to a young brute; nor, he suddenly
determined, on the butler’s hurrying out to Laura, who was standing on
the steps seeing him and Sally off, and saying with urgency, ‘Lord
Streatley to speak to Mrs. Luke on the telephone,’ would it be his hand
that delivered her up to an old one. At once on hearing the message he
started the car, and was out of the square before Laura could say
anything. There was Sally, tucked up beside him in Laura’s furs, and
looking more beautiful in broad sunshine even than he remembered her the
night before,&mdash;a child of light and grace if ever there was one, thought
Charles, a thing of simple sweetness and obedience and trust; and was he
going to bring her back to another evening’s exploitation by his sister
and her precious friends, with that old scoundrel, his elder brother,
all over her?</p>

<p>Never, said Charles to himself; and headed his car for Crippenham.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Crippenham was where his father was. What so safe as a refuge for Sally
as his father? He was ninety-three, and he was deaf. A venerable age; a
convenient failing. Convenient indeed in this case, for the Duke, like
Charles, took little pleasure in the speech of the lower classes. Also
he was alone there till Laura<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_252">{252}</a></span> should come back to him on the following
day, because nobody was ever invited to Crippenham, which was his yearly
rest-cure, and nobody ever dared even try to disturb its guarded repose.</p>

<p>Charles felt that it was, besides being the only, the very place. Here
Sally could be kept remote and hidden till Laura&mdash;not he; he wouldn’t be
able to do such a thing&mdash;restored her to where she belonged; here she
would be safe from the advances of Streatley, who couldn’t follow her
anywhere his father was, because the old man had an aversion to the four
surviving fruits of his first marriage, and freely showed it; and here
he would have her to himself for a whole evening, and part at least of
the next day.</p>

<p>Also, it would serve Laura right. She would get a fright, and think all
sorts of things had happened when they didn’t come back. Well, thought
Charles, she deserved everything she got. Under the cloak of protecting
and comforting Sally she had been completely selfish and cruel. Charles
was himself astonished at the violence of his feelings towards Laura,
with whom he had always been such friends. He didn’t investigate these
feelings, however; he didn’t investigate any of his other feelings
either, not excepting the one he had when he asked Sally, soon after
they had turned the corner out of the square, if she were warm enough,
and she looked up shyly at him, and smiled as she politely thanked him,
for his feelings since the evening before no longer bore investigation.
They were a mixed lot, a strong lot. And it vexed Charles to know that
even as early in the day as this, and not much after half past nine in
the morning, he wished to kiss Sally.</p>

<p>This wasn’t at all the proper spirit of rescue. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_253">{253}</a></span> drove in silence. He
couldn’t remember having wished to kiss a woman before at half past nine
in the morning, and it annoyed him.</p>

<p>Sally, of course, was silent too. Not for her to speak without being
spoken to, and she sat mildly wondering that she should be going along
in a car at all. Laura had come up to her bedroom and said her brother
was there, wanting to take her out for a little fresh air. Do her good,
Laura had said, though Sally had never known good come of fresh air yet;
but, passive as a parcel, she had let herself be taken. Why, however,
she should be going for a joy-ride with this lord she didn’t know,
though she supposed it was as good a way as another of getting through
the intimidating day among the picks of the basket, and anyhow this way
there was only one of them, and anyhow he wasn’t the big old one with
the hairs on his hands.</p>

<p>Queer lot, these picks, thought Sally. Didn’t seem to have anything to
do to keep them at home; seemed to spend their time going somewhere
else. Fidgety. And a vision of her own life as it was going to be once
she was settled in those rooms at Cambridge, getting ready for her
little baby, and cleaning up, and making things cosy for her man,
flooded her heart with a delicious warmth. Laura had promised to help
her find the rooms, and take her to where Mr. Luke would be. Mr. Luke
wouldn’t be angry any more now, thought Sally&mdash;he’d be too pleased about
the little baby; and Laura seemed to know exactly where they would find
him, and had assured her he wouldn’t want to have Mrs. Luke living with
them. Laura was queer too, in Sally’s eyes, but good. Indeed Sally,
feeling very much the married woman after what had happened the evening
before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_254">{254}</a></span> feeling motherly already, feeling exalted by the coming of her
baby to a height immensely above mere spinsterhood, went so far as to
say to herself of Laura, with indulgent affection, ‘Nice kid.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>They lunched at Thaxted. It was still only half past twelve, and Charles
had managed to be three hours doing the forty odd miles. There was a
beautiful church at Thaxted in which he could linger with her, for he
didn’t want to get to Crippenham till tea-time, and Crippenham was only
about nine miles beyond Cambridge, off the Ely road between Waterbeach
and Swaffham Prior.</p>

<p>Up to Thaxted, Charles was filled with an embarrassingly strong desire
to appropriate Sally for ever to himself. He hadn’t an idea how to do
it, but that was his wish. She sat there silent, beautiful beyond his
dreams&mdash;and how often and how wistfully had he not dreamt of what a
woman’s beauty might be!&mdash;pathetic, defenceless in the midst of a rudely
jostling, predatory world, like a child with a priceless pearl in its
hand among the poor and hungry, and he passionately loved her. As the
miles increased, so did Charles’s passion. He looked at her sideways,
and each time with a fresh throb of wonder. He wove dreams about her; he
saw visions of magic casements and perilous seas, and she behind them,
protected, guarded, worshipped by him alone; his soul was filled with
poetry; he was lifted above himself by this Presence, this
Manifestation; he thought in terms of music; the whole of England sang.</p>

<p>But at Thaxted he felt different, and began to think Sally ought to be
with those she belonged to; and by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_255">{255}</a></span> time it was evening, and he was
meditating alone in the garden at Crippenham, he was quite sure of it.</p>

<p>At Thaxted he ordered the best lunch he could&mdash;Sally’s mouth watered as
she listened,&mdash;and while it was being got ready he took her into the
church. She was inattentively polite. The brisk movements of a big,
close-cropped man in a cassock, who strode busily about and made what
seemed to Sally a curtsey each time he crossed the middle aisle,
appeared to interest her much more than Charles’s remarks on the clear,
pale beauty of the building. It was rather like taking a dog to look at
things. Charles didn’t consciously think this, but there was an
unawareness about Sally when faced by the beauties of Thaxted Church,
and when faced, coming down, by the beauties of certain bits of the
country that singing April morning, which was very like, Charles
subconsciously thought, the unawareness of a dog. Ah, but how far, far
more beautiful she herself was than anything else, he thought; how
exquisite she looked in Laura’s chinchilla wrap, with the exalted
thoughts of the men who had built the church, thoughts frozen into the
delicate greys, and silvers, and rose-colours of that fair wide place,
for her background.</p>

<p>The man in the cassock left off doing whatever he was doing on catching
sight of Sally, and, after looking at her a moment, came up and offered,
his eyes on her face, to show them round the church; a little cluster of
Americans dissolved, and flowed towards her; and a woman dressed like a
nun broke off her prayers, and presently sidled up to where she stood.</p>

<p>Charles removed her.</p>

<p>Thaxted is a quiet place, and he strolled with her through its streets
till their food should be ready. Its<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_256">{256}</a></span> streets, quiet to begin with,
didn’t stay quiet. The people of Thaxted, for some reason
incomprehensible to Charles, because no two women could be more unlike,
seemed to think Sally was Mary Pickford. He heard whispers to that
effect. Did they then think, too, that he was the person known, he
understood, as Doug?</p>

<p>He removed her a second time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the inn was as good a place as any to wait in. He had, however,
to engage a private room for their lunch, because so many people came in
and wished to lunch too; and it was when Sally had eaten a great deal of
greengage tart and cream&mdash;bottled greengages, Charles feared, but she
said she liked them&mdash;and drunk a great deal of raspberry syrup which
had, he was sure, never been near real raspberries and couldn’t be very
good for her, and then, while he was having coffee and she tea&mdash;he had
somehow stumbled on the fact that she liked tea after meals, and he
watched with concern the strength and number of the cups she drank&mdash;it
was then that she began to thaw, and to talk.</p>

<p>Alas, that she should. Alas, that she didn’t remain for ever silent,
wonderful, mysterious, of God.</p>

<p>Once having started thawing, it wasn’t in Sally’s generous nature to
stop. She thawed and thawed, and Charles became more and more afflicted.
Lord Charles&mdash;so, the night before, she had learned he was called&mdash;was
evidently a chip off the same block as her friend Laura; kind, that is.
See what a lovely dinner he was giving her. Also he had been much more
like a gentleman that day, and less like somebody who wanted to be a
husband; and after the greengage tart she began to warm up, and by the
time she had got to the cups of tea she felt great confidence in
Charles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_257">{257}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Kind, ain’t you,’ she said with her enchanting smile, when he
suggested, much against his convictions, another pot of tea.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t everybody?’ asked Charles.</p>

<p>‘Does their best,’ said Sally charitably. ‘But it’s up ’ill all the way
for some as I could mention.’</p>

<p>By this time Charles was already feeling chilled. The raspberry syrup
and the cups of strong tea had estranged him. This perfect girl, he
thought, ought to be choice too in her food, ought instinctively to
reject things out of bottles, and have no desire for a second helping of
obviously bad pastry. Still, she was very young. He too, at Eton, had
liked bad tuck. After all, queer as it seemed, she had only got to the
age he was at then.</p>

<p>He made excuses for her; and, it appearing to him important that he
should be in possession of more facts about her than those Laura had
told him the evening before, said encouragingly, ‘Do mention them.’</p>

<p>Sally did. She mentioned everybody and everything; and soon he knew as
much about her hasty marriage, hurried on within a fortnight to the
first man who came along, her return from her honeymoon to South Winch,
the determination of her mother-in-law to keep her apart from her
husband, her flight, helped by her father-in-law, back to her father,
his rejection of her, and her intention to rejoin her husband next day
at Cambridge whether he liked it or not, as he could bear.</p>

<p>He couldn’t bear much. It wasn’t only how she said it, but what she
said. Charles, who had at first been afflicted by her language, was now
afflicted by her facts. He shifted uneasily in his chair. He smoked
cigarette after cigarette. His thin brown face was flushed, and he
looked distressed. In that strange, defective, yet all<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_258">{258}</a></span> too vivid speech
which he so deeply deplored, she drew for him a picture of what seemed
sheer exploitation, culminating in his own sister’s flinging herself
hilariously into the game. This child; this helpless child, who would
obey anybody, go anywhere, do anything she was told&mdash;in Charles’s eyes,
as he listened and drew her out, she became the most pathetic thing on
earth. Everybody, it appeared, first grabbed at her and then wanted to
get rid of her. Everybody; himself too. Yes, he too had grabbed at her,
under a mealy-mouthed pretence of helping her, and now he too
wanted&mdash;not to get rid of her, that seemed too violent, too brutal a way
of putting it, but to hand her over, to pass her on, to send her back to
that infernal young Luke, who himself was trying to escape from her and
leave her to his mother. And the courage of the child! It was the
courage of ignorance, of course, but still it seemed to Charles a lovely
thing, that was afraid of nothing, of no discomfort, of no hard work, if
only she might be with her husband in their own home. Charles discovered
that that was Sally’s one wish, and that her simple ambition appeared to
be to do what she called work her fingers to the bone on behalf of that
odious youth.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Luke,’ said Sally, who was unacquainted with any reason why she
shouldn’t say everything she knew to anyone who wished to hear, ‘Mr.
Luke, ’e thinks ’e can’t afford a ’ome yet for me, and so&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Then he oughtn’t to have married you,’ flashed out Charles, infuriated
by the young brute.</p>

<p>‘Seemed ’e couldn’t ’elp it,’ said Sally. ‘Seemed as if it ’ad to be.
’E&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, <i>yes</i>,’ interrupted Charles impatiently, for he hated hearing
anything about Jocelyn’s emotions. ‘Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_259">{259}</a></span> course, of course. That was a
quite foolish remark of mine.’</p>

<p>‘Five ’undred pounds a year ’e got,’ went on Sally, ‘and me able to make
sixpence go twice as far as most can. Dunno wot ’e’s talkin’ about.’</p>

<p>And indeed she didn’t know, for she shared Mr. Pinner’s opinion that
five hundred a year was wealth.</p>

<p>‘Fair beats me,’ she added, after a thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>Well, thought Charles, the Moulsford family had behaved badly, and,
under the cloak of sympathy and wishing to help, his and Laura’s conduct
had been most base; but they were certainly going to make up for it now.
By God, yes. Crippenham, which he had at first thought of from sheer
selfishness as the very place to get Sally to himself in, was evidently
now the place of all others from which she could be helped. Quite close
to Cambridge, within easy reach of young Luke, and in it, all-powerful
even now in spite of his age, certainly all-powerful when it came to
putting the fear of God into an undergraduate, or whatever he was, his
ancient but still inflammable father. Naturally at ninety-three the old
man consisted principally of embers; but these embers could still be
fanned into a partial glow by the sight of a good horse or a beautiful
woman, and Charles would only need to show Sally to him to have the old
man on her side. Not able to hear, but able to see: what combination
could, in the case of Sally, possibly be more admirable?</p>

<p>He drove on after lunch, his conscience clear; so clear that before
leaving Thaxted he sent Laura a telegram telling her they were going to
Crippenham, because he no longer wanted her to be made anxious,&mdash;for
those only, thought Charles, are angry and wish to make others<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_260">{260}</a></span>
uncomfortable who are themselves in the wrong. He was no longer in the
wrong; or, rather, he was no longer thinking with rapture of the wrong
he would like to be in if Sally could be in it with him. Her speech made
a gulf between them which his fastidious soul couldn’t cross. There had
to be h’s before Charles could love with passion. Where there were none,
passion with him collapsed and died. On this occasion it died at the inn
at Thaxted towards the end of lunch; and he was grateful, really,
however unpleasant at the moment its dying was. For what mightn’t have
happened if she had gone on being silent and only saying yes and no, and
smiling the divine, delicious smile that didn’t only play in her dimples
but laughed and danced in her darling eyes? Charles was afraid that in
that case he would have been done for. Talking, she had saved him; and
though he still loved her, for no man could look at Sally and not love
her, he loved her differently,&mdash;kindly, gently, with a growingly
motherly concern for her welfare. After Thaxted there was no further
trace in his looks and manner of that which had made Sally suspect him
of a wish to be a husband.</p>

<p>But she was surprised when he asked her, as they drove along, whether
she would mind if he took her to his father in the country for the
night, instead of back to what he called noisy London. Laura was in
London; why should she be taken somewhere else, away from her? And to
his father too&mdash;to more picks, fresh ones; just as she was beginning to
shake down nicely with the ones she knew. Surely the father of the picks
would be the most frightening of all?</p>

<p>So she said, ‘Pardon?’ and looked so much alarmed that Charles, smiling,
explained that his father was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_261">{261}</a></span> staying at that moment quite near
Cambridge, and it would be convenient for the search for rooms she had
told him Laura had promised to undertake with her next day.</p>

<p>‘He’s quite harmless,’ Charles assured her, for she continued to look
alarmed&mdash;if where she was to be taken to next was near Cambridge, it
must also be near Woodles, and suppose her father were to happen to see
her?&mdash;‘and he’s all alone there till Laura goes back to him tomorrow. It
will cheer him up to have us. He’s ninety-three.’</p>

<p>Ninety-three? ‘Oh, my,’ said Sally politely. ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>E ain’t ’alf old. Poor
old gentleman,’ she added with compassion, old people having been
objects of special regard and attention in the Pinner circle.</p>

<p>But for the rest of the drive she was silent, for she was trying to
thread her way among her indistinct and entangled thoughts, all of which
seemed confusedly to press upon her notice that she oughtn’t to be where
she was at all, that if she was anywhere it ought to be with her
husband, and that with every hour that passed she was sinking deeper and
deeper in wrong-doing.</p>

<p>‘Soon be in right up to the neck,’ she said to herself with resigned
unhappiness; and sincerely wished it were that time tomorrow, and she
safely joined up with Mr. Luke, and finished for good and all with these
soft-spoken but headstrong picks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_262">{262}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">While</span> they, along the roads, were drawing every minute nearer, the
unconscious Duke was sitting in his plain study, having his plain tea,
which had been set beside him by his plain parlourmaid. This is not to
say that the parlourmaid was ill-favoured, but only that she wasn’t a
footman.</p>

<p>There were no footmen at Crippenham. There was hardly anything there,
except the Duke. For years it had been his conviction that this annual
fortnight of the rest that is obtained by complete contrast prolonged
his life. Something evidently prolonged it, and the Duke was sure it was
Crippenham. There he went every Easter alone with Laura, because it was
a small house, and an ugly house, and a solitary house, and had nothing
to recommend it except that it was the exact opposite of every other
Moulsford possession.</p>

<p>Only Charles could come and go as he pleased; only he could dare break
in without notice on the sacred yearly business of prolonging life.
Although he had had ninety-three years of it, the Duke still wanted
more. He liked being alive, and it pleased him to keep Streatley
waiting. Streatley, and the other three children of his first
marriage&mdash;absurd, he thought, to have to refer to those four old things
as children&mdash;were unpopular with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_263">{263}</a></span> their father. He had never at any time
cared much for them, and had begun to be really angry with them when he
was a lively seventy, and perceived that the possession of children
bordering on a heavy fifty made him seem less young than he felt himself
to be. Now that they were practically seventy themselves, and old
seventies too, and he not looking a day different, he hoped, from what
he had looked thirty years before, he was angrier with them than ever.
He admitted that other people might be old at ninety-three, but he
wasn’t; he was the exception. He didn’t feel old, and he didn’t, he
considered, look old, so what was all this talk of age? The press never
mentioned him without the prefix venerable; people pretended he was
deaf, when he could hear as well as any man if he wasn’t mumbled at;
Laura was continually making him sit out of draughts, just as if he were
a damned invalid; arms were offered him if he wanted to walk a few
steps&mdash;he couldn’t appear in the House without some officious member of
it, usually that ass Chepstow, who was eighty if a day himself, ambling
across to help; and every time he had a birthday the newspapers tumbled
over each other with their offensively astonished congratulations.
Couldn’t a man be over ninety without having it perpetually rubbed into
him that he was old?</p>

<p>What he loved was his brood of young ones&mdash;Laura, Terry, and Charles;
and of this lively trio the dearest to him was Charles. So that, looking
up from his seedcake and seeing his last born coming into the room, not
only entirely unexpectedly but with a young woman, though he was
surprised he wasn’t angry; and when on their coming close to him he
perceived the exceeding fairness of the young woman, his surprise
became<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_264">{264}</a></span> pleasurable; very pleasurable; in fact, pleasurable to excess.</p>

<p>He stared up at Sally a moment, not listening to what Charles was
saying, and then struggled to get on to his feet. Younger than his three
young ones ... much, much younger than his three young ones ... youth,
ah, youth ... lovely, lovely youth....</p>

<p>Charles wanted to help him, but was thrust aside. ‘Poor old gentleman,’
said Sally, catching him by the arm as he seemed about to lose his
balance and drop back into the chair.</p>

<p>‘Married?’ asked the Duke, breathing hard after his exertion, and
looking at Charles.</p>

<p>Charles shook his head.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Course I’m married,’ said Sally with heat.</p>

<p>‘He means us,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Us?’ repeated Sally, much shocked.</p>

<p>‘You’re going to be, then,’ said the Duke, looking first at her and then
at Charles, his face red with pleasure.</p>

<p>Charles shook his head again, and laughed.</p>

<p>But the Duke didn’t laugh. He stared at him a minute, and then said,
‘Fool.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>got</i> a nusband,’ said Sally indignantly.</p>

<p>‘He can’t hear,’ said Charles. ‘He’s very deaf.’</p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ asked the Duke. ‘Speak clearly, my dear&mdash;no, don’t
shout,’ he added; though Sally, far from going to shout, wasn’t even
opening her mouth. Poor old gentleman, she thought, gazing at him in
silent compassion; fancy him still being anybody’s father.</p>

<p>The Duke took her hand in a dry, cold grip.</p>

<p>‘Like shakin’ ’ands with a tombstone,’ thought Sally.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_265">{265}</a></span> And she was
filled with so great a pity for anything so old that she didn’t feel shy
of him at all, and in the coaxing voice of one who is addressing a baby
she said, ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ave yer tea while it’s ’ot&mdash;do, now.’</p>

<p>Charles looked at her astonished. Nearly everybody was afraid of his
father. She reminded him of the weaned child in Isaiah, who put its hand
fearlessly on the cockatrice’s den.</p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ asked the Duke, gazing at her with delight.</p>

<p>‘This is Mrs. Luke, Father&mdash;a friend of Laura’s,’ shouted Charles, ‘and
I’ve brought her&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Write it down, my dear,’ said the Duke, not heeding Charles, and
drawing Sally into a chair next his own and pushing paper and a pencil
towards her with his shaking old hands. ‘Write down what you were saying
to me.’</p>

<p>Charles became anxious. He felt sure Sally couldn’t write anything down.
Nor could she; for if her spoken words were imperfect her written ones
were worse, so that to be given a pencil and paper by the Duke and told
to write might have been embarrassing if she hadn’t, owing to his
extreme age and evident dilapidation, felt he wasn’t, as she said to
herself, all there. Poor old gentleman, she thought, full of pity. What
she saw, sitting heavily in the chair, breathing hard and blinking at
her so kindly, was just, thought Sally, the remains, the left-overs;
like, she said to herself, her images being necessarily domestic,
Sunday’s dinner by the time one got to Friday,&mdash;not much good, that is,
but had to be put up with. No; there was nothing frightening about
<i>him</i>, poor old gentleman. More like a baby than anything else.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Ave yer tea while it’s ’ot,’ she said again, gently<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_266">{266}</a></span> putting the paper
and pencil aside. ‘Do you good,’ she encouraged, ‘a nice ’ot cup of tea
will.’</p>

<p>‘He can’t hear, you know,’ said Charles, much relieved by Sally’s
attitude. But with what confidence, he thought, couldn’t a thing so
gracious approach the most churlish, disgruntled of human beings; and
his father wasn’t either churlish or disgruntled,&mdash;he only looked as if
he were, and frightened people, and when he saw they were frightened he
didn’t like them, and frightened them more than ever.</p>

<p>The Duke, watching Sally’s every movement with rapt attention, thought
when she put her hand on the teapot to feel if it was still hot that she
wanted tea herself, and bade Charles ring the bell and order more to be
brought, and meanwhile he took the cup she offered him obediently, his
eyes on her face. He hadn’t got as far, being still in too great a
condition of amazement at her beauty, as wondering which of the ancient
families of England had produced this young shoot of perfection, and not
being able to hear a word she said took it for granted that the
delicate-ankled&mdash;he was of the practically extinct generation that looks
first at a woman’s ankles,&mdash;slender-fingered creature belonged to his
own kind. True her hands were red hands; surprisingly red, he thought,
on her presently taking off her gloves, which she rolled up together
into a neat tight ball, compared to the flawless fairness of her face;
but they were the authentic shape of good-breeding, even if her
nails&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Duke was really surprised when his eyes reached Sally’s nails.</p>

<p>Charles drew a chair close up to his father, and began his explanations.
He was determined the old man<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_267">{267}</a></span> should attend, and shouted well into his
ear as he told him that he had motored Laura’s friend, Mrs. Luke, down
from London, where she had been staying with Laura at Goring House, to
Crippenham for the night because it was quieter, and she hadn’t been
well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<i>I’m</i> all right,’ interrupted Sally, who had been listening in an
attitude of polite attention.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear child&mdash;when you fainted,’ protested Charles in his ordinary
voice, raising a deprecating hand.</p>

<p>‘Speak up,’ said the Duke, impatiently.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Course I fainted,’ said Sally, looking pleased.</p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ asked the Duke.</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;and were unconscious for at least half an hour,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘That’s right. <i>And</i> sick,’ said Sally, looking proud.</p>

<p>‘Sick? Were you sick as well? Then see how really ill&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Speak up, speak up,’ said the Duke testily.</p>

<p>But Sally said nothing further, and merely smiled indulgently at
Charles.</p>

<p>‘What did she say?’ asked the Duke, not wishing to lose a word that fell
from that enchanting mouth.</p>

<p>‘She said,’ shouted Charles, ‘that she is quite well now.’</p>

<p>‘Of course she is,’ said the Duke, staring at her face and forgetting
her nails. ‘Anyone can see she is as perfectly well as she is perfectly
beautiful.’</p>

<p>‘Oh lor,’ thought Sally, ‘now <i>’e’s</i> goin’ to begin.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>That afternoon and evening were a triumph for her if she had known it,
but all she knew was that she was counting the hours to next day, and
Jocelyn, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_268">{268}</a></span> settling down at last to her home and her duties. The
old man was her slave. Crippenham and everything in it was laid at her
feet, and the Duke only lamented that it should be to this one of his
houses that she had come, where he couldn’t, he was afraid, make her
even decently comfortable. Positively at Crippenham there was only one
bathroom. The Duke seemed to regard this as a calamity, and Sally
listened with mild wonder to the amount he had to say about it.</p>

<p>‘Fair ’arps on it, don’t ’e, poor old gentleman,’ she remarked to
Charles; and bending over to the Duke’s ear&mdash;Charles looked on in
astonishment at the fearless familiarity of the gesture&mdash;she tried to
convey to him that it wasn’t Saturday night till the next night, and
that by then she’d be in Cambridge, so there was no need for him to take
on.</p>

<p>‘Eh?’ said the Duke. ‘What does she say?’ he asked Charles.</p>

<p>‘She says,’ shouted Charles, ‘that it doesn’t matter.’</p>

<p>How very glad he was that his father was so deaf. Often he had found his
deafness trying, but how glad he was of it now. Not Saturday night....
Charles fell silent. It was then Friday. Could it be that since the
previous Saturday&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The Duke, however, knew nothing of Sally except what his eyes told him,
and accordingly he was her slave. When she presently went up to Laura’s
room with the housekeeper, who had instructions to place everything of
Lady Laura’s at Mrs. Luke’s disposal&mdash;Crippenham had no spare rooms,
only a room each for the Duke, and Charles, and Laura, the other six or
seven bedrooms being left unfurnished and kept locked up&mdash;and Charles,
who from long practice could make his father hear better<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_269">{269}</a></span> than anyone
except Laura, settled down to telling him as much about Sally as he
thought prudent, the old man listened eagerly, his hand behind his ear,
drinking in every word and asking questions which showed that if he was
really interested in a subject he still could be most shrewd.</p>

<p>He was delighted that Sally should have run away from her mother-in-law,
said it was proof of a fine, thoroughbred spirit, and asked who her
father was.</p>

<p>Charles said his name was Pinner.</p>

<p>The Duke then inquired whether he were one of the Worcestershire
Pinners, and Charles said he didn’t know.</p>

<p>The Duke then rambled off among his capacious memories, and presently
brought back a Pinner who had been at Christchurch with him, and who had
married, he said, one of the Dartmoors, an extremely handsome woman,
fair too, who was probably the girl’s grandmother.</p>

<p>Charles merely bowed his head.</p>

<p>The Duke then asked who the Lukes, apart from this boy-husband at
Ananias, were; for, he said, except the fellow in the Bible, he couldn’t
recollect ever having heard of a Luke before.</p>

<p>Charles said all he knew was that they lived at South Winch.</p>

<p>‘What?’ cried the Duke. ‘Has she married beneath her?’&mdash;and was so
really upset that for a time he blinked at Charles in silence. Because
he felt that if only this dear son of his had secured the beautiful
young creature he could have died content; and it seemed to him a double
catastrophe that not only should his boy have missed her, but that she
should have been caught into a misalliance with some obscure family in a
suburb.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_270">{270}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Upon my word, Charles,’ he said, after a dismayed silence, ‘that’s a
pity. A very great pity.’</p>

<p>And rambling off into his memories again, he said it was a good thing
that poor Jack Pinner was dead, for no man had a keener family feeling
than he, and it would have broken his heart to think his grand-daughter
had made a mistake of that kind.</p>

<p>He couldn’t get over it. He had never, in the whole of his long life,
seen anyone to touch this girl for beauty, and that she should, at the
very outset of what ought to have been a career of unparalleled
splendour and success, have dropped out of her proper sphere and become
entangled in a suburb really shocked him. Kings at her feet, all Europe
echoing with her name&mdash;this seemed to the Duke such beauty’s proper
accompaniment.</p>

<p>‘Tut, tut,’ he said, his hands, clasped on the top of his stick, shaking
more than usual, ‘tut, tut, tut. What was her mother thinking of?’</p>

<p>‘Her mother is dead,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Her father, then. Jack Pinner was no fool. I don’t understand how his
son&mdash;where is he, by the way? I heard something about the Worcestershire
estates having been sold after the war&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Charles said he didn’t know where her father was, because, although
Sally had told him the shop was at Woodles, he had never heard of
Woodles, which indeed is not marked on any map, so that he felt he
wasn’t lying in saying he didn’t know.</p>

<p>The Duke, however, appeared to be seized by a sudden fierce desire to
track down his old friend’s reprehensible son and tell him what he
thought of him, and Charles was dismayed, for no good, he was sure,
could come of tracking down Mr. Pinner. Sally, he knew, was anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_271">{271}</a></span> her
father shouldn’t find out her disobedience to his orders, and though of
this disobedience Charles held Laura guilty, not Sally, yet he didn’t
suppose Mr. Pinner would look at it like that, and it was, besides,
important, Charles considered, that his father, who had always had a
rooted objection to any woman who wasn’t well-bred, should go on
thinking Sally was a Worcestershire Pinner.</p>

<p>It seemed, then, to Charles a good thing to keep his father and Mr.
Pinner apart, and it was therefore with regret that he listened to the
old man asking Sally the moment he next saw her, which wasn’t till
dinner, for she stayed up in her room till fetched down by the
scandalised housekeeper, to whom it was a new experience that His Grace
should be kept waiting even a minute after the gong had sounded, where
her father was.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Im?’ said Sally, turning pale but forced by nature and her upbringing
to an obedient truthfulness. ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>E’s at Woodles, ’<i>e</i> is.’ And, ‘Oh my
gracious,’ she added to herself, ‘they ain’t goin’ to tell ’im I’m
’ere?’</p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ the Duke asked Charles.</p>

<p>‘She says,’ shouted Charles, following his father, who was shuffling
along leaning on Sally’s arm, to the dining-room, and shouting with
outward composure but inward regret, ‘that he is at Woodles.’</p>

<p>‘Woodles? Woodles?’ repeated the Duke. ‘Never heard of it. Is it in
Worcestershire?’</p>

<p>Sally shook her head. She didn’t know where Worcestershire was, but she
felt pretty sure Woodles wasn’t in it.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> dunno wot it’s in,’ she said. And then, impelled as always to the
naked truth, she added, ‘Close by ’ere, any’ow.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ inquired the Duke, turning again to Charles.</p>

<p>‘She says,’ shouted Charles, obliged to hand on the answer correctly
with Sally listening, but doing so with increased regret, ‘that it isn’t
far from here.’</p>

<p>‘How very lucky,’ said the Duke, ‘and how very odd that I shouldn’t have
known he was so near.’ And he added, when he had been lowered into his
chair at the head of the table by the parlourmaid, who held one arm, and
his servant, who held the other, ‘I’d like to have a talk with that
father of yours, my dear.’</p>

<p>Sally turned paler.</p>

<p>‘Your grandfather was one of my oldest friends,’ continued the Duke,
with difficulty unfolding his table-napkin because of how much his hands
shook.</p>

<p>‘I ain’t <i>got</i> no grandfather,’ said Sally anxiously, who had never
heard of him till that moment.</p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ asked the Duke.</p>

<p>‘She says,’ began Charles reluctantly&mdash;‘You know,’ he muttered quickly
to Sally, for how could he tell the old man what she had said? ‘you
<i>have</i> a grandfather&mdash;or had. You must have. Everybody has them.’</p>

<p>‘What? What?’ said the Duke impatiently. ‘Send a message round tonight,
Charles, and say with my compliments that I’d very much like to see
Pinner. Tell him I’m too old to go to him, so perhaps he’ll be obliging
enough to come to me some time tomorrow. You can say his father was at
Oxford with me if you like, and that I’ve only just heard he is in the
neighbourhood. Say his daughter&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Now don’t&mdash;now <i>don’t</i> go doin’ a thing like that,’ Sally faintly
begged of Charles.</p>

<p>‘What does she say?’ asked the Duke.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_273">{273}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Do you think it’s wise to break your rule of never seeing anybody while
you’re here?’ shouted Charles. ‘You shouldn’t,’ he added to Sally, ‘have
told him about Woodles.’</p>

<p>‘But ’e <i>ask</i> me,’ said Sally, distressed.</p>

<p>‘You’re not obliged to tell everybody everything,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘But if they <i>asks</i> me&mdash;&mdash;’ said Sally, almost in tears.</p>

<p>The Duke became suddenly cross. ‘I hate all this muttering,’ he said.
‘Why on earth can’t you speak up, Charles?’</p>

<p>Charles spoke up. ‘It’s impossible to send tonight, Father,’ he shouted.
‘If you won’t keep servants here you can’t send messages.’</p>

<p>‘Then you can go yourself tomorrow,’ said the Duke.</p>

<p>‘Now don’t&mdash;now <i>don’t</i> go doin’ a thing like that,’ implored Sally
again.</p>

<p>‘And bring him back in your car,’ said the Duke.</p>

<p>‘I believe Mrs. Luke would rather not see her father,’ shouted Charles.</p>

<p>‘That’s right,’ said Sally, nodding her head emphatically. It did sound
awful though&mdash;not wanting to see one’s father. ‘Ain’t I gettin’ wicked
<i>quick</i>,’ she thought; and hung her head.</p>

<p>He didn’t seem to think so, however, the old gentleman didn’t, for he
leant across to her looking as pleasant as pleasant, and patted her
shoulder with his poor shaky old hand, and said she was quite right.
Right? Poor old gentleman, thought Sally&mdash;past even knowing good from
bad.</p>

<p>The Duke bent across and patted her shoulder, a broad smile on his face.
Such spirit&mdash;running away from her mother-in-law, and kicking at seeing
her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_274">{274}</a></span>father&mdash;delighted him. She was a high-stepper, this lovely, noble
little lady, and all his life he had admired only those women whose
steps were high.</p>

<p>‘You shan’t see him, my dear,’ he said. ‘Quite right, quite right not to
wish to.’ And just as she was heaving a sigh of thankfulness he added,
‘But <i>I</i> will. I really must have a talk with him.’</p>

<p>Strange, thought Charles, this determination to talk with Sally’s
father. How much better, how much more really useful, to talk with her
husband, or her mother-in-law.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>After dinner, which Sally ate reluctantly, for she well knew by now that
her ways with knives and forks were somehow different from the ways of
people like Lukes and dukes, and she felt, besides, that the old
gentleman’s eye was on her&mdash;which it was, but her face, for she was of
course now without her hat, engrossed his whole attention, and he saw
nothing that her hands were doing&mdash;after dinner, after, that is, the
small cups of clear soup and the grilled cutlets with floury potatoes
which were the evening meal at Crippenham during the severity of the
retreat, Charles went into the garden to smoke.</p>

<p>It was a small garden, with nothing in it but a plot of rough grass,
some shrubs, a tree or two, and in one corner the shut up four-roomed
cottage his father had had built for him and Laura and Terry twenty-five
years ago, when first he bought Crippenham, to play at housekeeping in.
For years it had been unused; a melancholy object, Charles thought
whenever he went into the garden and saw it there, smothered in creepers
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_275">{275}</a></span> deserted, a relic of vanished youth, a reminder that one was
getting old.</p>

<p>Beneath its silent walls he wandered up and down, thinking. Every now
and then, drawn by the light streaming out through the uncurtained
window of his father’s study, he crossed the grass and stood a moment
looking in, fascinated by the picture inside,&mdash;the two figures
brilliantly lit up, the hunched-up old man, with his great bald head
glistening in the light, talking, talking, and the exquisite girl, her
head bowed in a divine courtesy and patience, listening, though her
angelic little face was distinctly troubled. That was because of the
fear of her father, Charles knew. She needn’t be afraid. If the old man
insisted on seeing Pinner he would have to go to Woodles himself, for
Charles certainly wasn’t going to fetch the creature. Charles didn’t at
all like Mr. Pinner&mdash;imagine turning down a daughter, and such a
daughter, when she fled to him for sanctuary!&mdash;but though he didn’t like
him, and quite shared his father’s opinion that he should be talked to,
wisdom told him that the best thing to do with Mr. Pinner was to leave
him alone. The Lukes were the ones needing talking to. The Lukes were
the people to deal with. The Lukes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes; what line had he best take with his father in the conversation he
meant to have after their adorable guest had gone to bed? He wandered up
and down the path beneath the shuttered windows of the deserted cottage,
deep in reflection. It was clear to him that nobody except his father
could really help Sally. Laura, though she was provided with everything,
and more than everything, that she wanted, had no separate income of her
own, and could do nothing beyond giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_276">{276}</a></span> moral support. He himself
couldn’t lift a finger without at once causing scandal. His father
could; his father was the only person who could; and his father, Charles
determined, should. There were, then, after all, thought Charles, back
at the window again and staring through it, compensations in being so
old: one could help Sally. His father was revoltingly rich. It would be
nothing to him to set her on her feet. True, there was no earthly reason
why he should, but sometimes&mdash;great God, couldn’t a man sometimes come
out of the narrow ring of reason, get outside the circle of just claims,
forget his cautious charities, be unbusinesslike, break traditions,
shock solicitors, and for once in his life do something absurd, and
beautiful, and entirely for nothing?</p>

<p>Charles threw away his cigarette, and with his hands in his pockets took
a few quick strides about the little garden, excited, stirred out of his
customary calm. Why, even if the old man did as little for her as
interrupt his rest-cure for a few hours and take her into Cambridge
himself, just for the girl to be seen with him, just for her to appear
under his wing, would knock every obstacle out of her path, except that
one obstacle of young Luke’s poverty. His father knew the Master of
Ananias; his father knew everybody. They all listened when he spoke. The
merest indication of a wish would be attended to. It was, of course,
regrettable that there should be this attentiveness to a man merely
because he was rich and a duke, but by God, thought Charles, how damned
convenient.</p>

<p>He walked quickly about the little garden. His father must be made to
understand the situation. He would sit up all night if necessary,
getting it into his head. He would tell him everything Sally had told<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_277">{277}</a></span>
him, adding anything that should seem in his judgment effective, and
only keeping Mr. Pinner back, and the fact that the darling, lovely girl
was not at her best in conversation and no good at all at writing things
down. His father must take the Lukes by the hand; he must be led to
desire to do so above all things. Tact, skill, judgment,&mdash;Charles would
sit up all night exercising these. Mrs. Luke must be suppressed. The
unpleasant youth, who dared be angry, must be taught his incredible good
fortune in getting such a wife. Those Lukes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly Charles stood still.</p>

<p>Those Lukes....</p>

<p>Queer, but the words had sounded in his ears like a cry of pain.</p>

<p>He was down at the edge of the garden, which ended in a ditch, and on
the other side stretched flat, empty fields divided from each other by
hedges and rows of elms, darker than the darkness. The air smelt of damp
grass. The sky was wonderful, thick strewn with stars. A great peace lay
over the fields. They seemed folded in silence. He could hear nothing
but the croak of a far away frog. Why, then, had it seemed to him as
if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles stood motionless.</p>

<p>Those Lukes ... what must they not, since yesterday, have suffered?</p>

<p>Extraordinary, that he hadn’t thought of it before.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_278">{278}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Speaking</span> of this time later on, Mrs. Luke was accustomed to say, ‘It was
a <i>mauvais quart d’heure</i>,’ and to smile; but in her heart, when she
thought of it, there was no smile.</p>

<p>She never forgot that coming down to breakfast on the morning of Sally’s
flight, so unconscious of anything having happened, pleased that it was
a fine day for her party, pleased with the pretty frock she had had sent
from Harrods for the child to wear, excited at the prospect of
presenting her to a dazzled South Winch, confident, somehow, with that
curiously cloudless confidence that seems to lay hold of those about to
be smitten by fate, that her beautiful daughter-in-law would behave
perfectly, and the whole thing be a great success. Fate was about to
smite her; and with more than the disappearance of a daughter-in-law,
for that disappearance was but the first step to having to give up,
renounce entirely and for always, her son.</p>

<p>Jocelyn came down to breakfast in a good humour too. He had slept like a
log, after his series of interrupted nights.</p>

<p>‘Sally’s late,’ he said presently.</p>

<p>‘She is, isn’t she,’ said his mother. ‘You won’t call her Sally this
afternoon, will you, dearest,’ she added, giving him his coffee.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_279">{279}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Sorry, Mother. No. I’ll remember.’</p>

<p>And soon after that they made their discovery.</p>

<p>‘Now what,’ Mrs. Luke asked herself, pressing her cold hands together,
when an hour or two later it became evident beyond doubt that Sally
hadn’t merely gone, unaccountably, for an early walk, but had gone
altogether, ‘now what, what have I done to deserve this?’</p>

<p>And the period of torment began, the period of distress and anxiety, of
anger at first which soon flickered out, and of ever-growing, sickening
fear, which she afterwards spoke of quietly as a <i>mauvais quart
d’heure</i>.</p>

<p>It took some time before she and Jocelyn could be convinced that this
wasn’t just a before breakfast walk. They clung to the hope that it was,
in spite of their knowledge of Sally’s lack of initiative. Yet how much
more initiative would be needed, they thought, looking at each other
with frightened eyes, to do that which it became every moment more and
more apparent that she had done.</p>

<p>‘But why? But why?’ Mrs. Luke kept on asking, pressing her cold hands
together.</p>

<p>Jocelyn said nothing.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock, when it was plain she wasn’t coming back, he went out
and fetched his car.</p>

<p>‘She’s gone to her father,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘But why? Oh, Jocelyn&mdash;why?’</p>

<p>‘We’ve made her unhappy,’ he said, pulling on his gloves, his face set.</p>

<p>‘Unhappy?’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> have, anyway. I’ve been an infernal cad&mdash;I tell you I <i>have</i>,’ he
said, turning on his mother. ‘It’s no good your telling me I haven’t&mdash;I
<i>have</i>.’</p>

<p>And he drove off, leaving her at the gate pressing her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_280">{280}</a></span> cold hands
together, and staring after him with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>But his coming back was worse than his going. It was after six before he
got home, tired and dusty, at the fag end of the terrible party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke hadn’t seen how not to have the party, and had told her
friends&mdash;ah, how much she shrank from them&mdash;when they trooped in
punctually at half-past four, eager to see Jocelyn’s bride, that her
daughter-in-law very unfortunately had had to go that morning to her
father, who had suddenly fallen ill.</p>

<p>‘An old man,’ said poor Mrs. Luke&mdash;after dreary and painful thought she
had come to the conclusion that if she said it was Sally who had fallen
ill, Hammond would be sure sooner or later to give her away,&mdash;‘an old
man, I’m afraid, and liable to&mdash;liable to&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>What was he liable to? Mrs. Luke’s brain wouldn’t work. Her lips, forced
into the continual smile of the hostess, trembled. She wanted to cry.
How badly, how badly she wanted just to sit down in a corner alone, and
cry.</p>

<p>Then Jocelyn came back. There were still the Walkers there, and Miss
Cartwright, and old Mrs. Pugh. Why wouldn’t they go? Why did they hang
on, and hang on, and never, never go?</p>

<p>They all heard the car. They all knew it was his, because it made so
much more noise than anybody else’s, and they all knew, because Mrs.
Luke had told them, that he had motored his wife himself that morning to
her sick father.</p>

<p>‘Ah. <i>Now</i> we shall have the bulletin,’ said the Canon cheerfully; for
the illness, probably slight, of an unknown young lady’s almost
certainly inglorious father<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_281">{281}</a></span> couldn’t be regarded, he felt, as an
occasion for serious gloom. ‘No doubt it is a good one, and Jocelyn has
been able to bring his wife back with him.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go and see,’ said Mrs. Luke, getting up quickly, and almost
running out of the room.</p>

<p>‘What a lot of trouble there is in the world, to be sure,’ said old Mrs.
Pugh, shaking her head, ‘what a lot of trouble.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean the father?’ asked Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p>‘Who <i>is</i> the father?’ asked Miss Cartwright.</p>

<p>‘Nobody knows,’ said the Canon.</p>

<p>‘Not really?’ said Miss Cartwright.</p>

<p>‘Hush&mdash;&mdash;’ said the Canon, raising his hand.</p>

<p>Outside the window, which was open, Jocelyn was speaking, and holding
their breaths they heard him say, ‘Well, Mother? What time did she get
back?’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>He had been to Mr. Pinner. He had heard what Mr. Pinner had to say. The
man had behaved well, had done his duty and sent her straight home; but
she hadn’t got there.</p>

<p>Fear now descended on Jocelyn’s and his mother’s souls,&mdash;fear ten times
greater than the fear of the morning; such fear that they were hardly
aware of the Walkers, and Miss Cartwright, and old Mrs. Pugh, and said
goodbye to them mechanically, and hadn’t an idea what any of them were
saying, and the dusk deepened, and night came, and it grew late, and
they sat listening and watching at the window, the window wide open so
as to catch the first sounds of a footstep on the path, and they sat in
almost complete silence, for they were too much frightened to speak.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_282">{282}</a></span></p>

<p>That child&mdash;somewhere out there in the darkness&mdash;that beautiful,
ignorant child, by herself in London&mdash;Sally, who had only to appear to
collect a crowd&mdash;Sally, so trustful, so ready to obey anybody....</p>

<p>But what did one <i>do</i>? Who did one go to? What <i>could</i> one do but still,
in the dark, not speaking, hardly breathing so intently were they
listening, wait?</p>

<p>Fragments of what Mr. Pinner had said drifted in and out of Jocelyn’s
brain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Told ’er to take a taxi all the way....’</p>

<p>‘Give ’er a pound, I did....’</p>

<p>‘Mistake was, lettin’ that there car go....’</p>

<p>That car? What car?</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ he said suddenly, ‘what car?’</p>

<p>‘What car, my darling?’</p>

<p>‘She arrived there in a car. Her father said so. I forgot to tell you.’</p>

<p>‘A car?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke got up quickly. So did he. She turned on the light, and it
shone on their pale faces staring at each other. He hadn’t remembered
the car till that moment.</p>

<p>Then without a word she went into the passage, snatched up a coat,
wrapped it round herself, and before he could speak was out of the
house. ‘Wait there,’ she called over her shoulder, ‘wait there&mdash;she
might come&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>A car. Whose car but Edgar’s? Had Edgar&mdash;&mdash;? Was Edgar&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>No, no. Impossible. She had arrived alone at her father’s, and the car
had left her there.</p>

<p>But Edgar must know&mdash;he could tell her....<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_283">{283}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The butler hadn’t wanted to let her in, seeing her looking so wild on
the steps when he answered the ring, and no hat on, and an old coat
pulled round her shoulders, and he well knowing the affair with his
master was off; but what did she care for butlers? She simply pushed
past him, and went straight to the library&mdash;the handsome,
Turkey-carpeted, leathery library she so vividly remembered&mdash;and there,
as she expected, sat Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>He was in a deep chair before a great wood fire, with beside him, on a
little Moorish table, his coffee and his liqueur, in his hands the
evening paper, and in his mouth a huge cigar. He didn’t look in the
least unhappy, nor did he look in the least as if he were still angry.
On the contrary, he looked contented and pleased. But this expression
changed when, turning his head on hearing the door open, he saw Mrs.
Luke.</p>

<p>‘Edgar,’ she said, coming quickly across to him, holding Jocelyn’s coat
together at her neck with shaking fingers, ‘where is Salvatia?’</p>

<p>And it was no use his staring at her as if she were a ghost, which
indeed at first he thought she must be, so totally unlike the nicely
dressed, ladylike Margery of his misplaced love was this white-faced,
ruffled-haired woman,&mdash;it was no use his staring at her openmouthed and
not answering, and then getting up with deliberation and ostentatiously
going towards the bell, for she took no notice of any of that, and went
on to say that Salvatia wasn’t with her father, who had sent her back to
South Winch at once that morning, and hadn’t come home. Did he know
where she was?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_284">{284}</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mr. Thorpe, in his turn, was frightened. Not with her father? Not
come home?</p>

<p>He stared at Mrs. Luke. What had he done? What, if that were the case,
had he done? And instead of the agreeable vision he had been so much
pleased with of paying out Margery and her stuck-up son, and the still
more agreeable vision of visiting Sally secretly and comfortably at her
father’s, and developing his friendship with her to almost any extent,
he saw, as he stood staring, a picture that really frightened him, a
picture of young beauty lost somehow in London, and quite peculiarly
defenceless.</p>

<p>What had he done?</p>

<p>But Mr. Thorpe was a man of action. Not his to wring his hands and wait
and hope; not his to waste time, either, confessing that he had behaved
abominably, and begging Margery’s pardon. He did both, but quickly,
economising words, and within five minutes was round at Almond Tree
Cottage, and within ten minutes his car was round there, and within an
hour he and Jocelyn were at Scotland Yard&mdash;Jocelyn, who also had no time
for anger with Mr. Thorpe, who had no time for anything but searching
for and rescuing Sally.</p>

<p>Nor did Mr. Thorpe say much to Jocelyn. His longest speech was to
remark, looking out of the window on his side of the car as they tore up
to London, that it was a pity one couldn’t get out of the habit of
behaving first and thinking afterwards. He could go no nearer than this
to apologising. He had done Jocelyn a great wrong, he knew, but he
couldn’t bring himself to say so. To the mother, yes; somehow it was
easier to eat humble pie to a woman. Contrition welled up in Mr. Thorpe,
but stuck in his throat. It wouldn’t come out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_285">{285}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Damned pity, eh?’ he repeated, though not as one who requires an
answer.</p>

<p>‘It’s so beastly <i>dark</i>,’ was all Jocelyn said, huddled, whitefaced and
sick, in the other corner.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Scotland Yard took down particulars.</p>

<p>‘Expense no object,’ said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘I can’t pay,’ said Jocelyn, who was shivering.</p>

<p>‘But I can,’ said Mr. Thorpe. ‘What you’ve got to do,’ he continued to
the official, ‘is to find her instantly&mdash;<i>instantly</i>, do you hear? Get a
move on. Not a minute to lose. If you’d seen her you’d understand&mdash;eh?’
he said, turning to Jocelyn for confirmation, who only shivered.</p>

<p>This great place&mdash;all the policemen they had met&mdash;all the being passed
on from one official to another&mdash;nothing but officials, officials
everywhere&mdash;it struck his heart cold. Sally in connection with this? He
couldn’t speak. His lips were dry. He felt sick.</p>

<p>‘Upset,’ said Mr. Thorpe confidentially to the official. ‘Husband. Bound
to be.’</p>

<p>The official nodded, and began telephoning.</p>

<p>‘I’ll let you know,’ he said to Mr. Thorpe, the receiver at his ear.
‘It’s no use your waiting here. Where can I&mdash;that you, Williams? Just
one moment&mdash;where can I ring you up?’</p>

<p>And he wrote down the name of the hotel Mr. Thorpe gave him, for Mr.
Thorpe wasn’t going to leave London till he had found Sally, not if he
had to stay in it ten years, and then bowed his head in abstracted
dismissal, his eyes gone absent-minded while he rapidly conversed with
the person at the other end of the telephone.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_286">{286}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Come on,’ said Mr. Thorpe, laying hold of Jocelyn’s arm.</p>

<p>He took him away to the hotel. The hotel was the Carlton. ‘Know me at
the Carlton,’ said Mr. Thorpe, who in the first year of his widowerhood,
before he felt justified in beginning to court Mrs. Luke, had sometimes
consoled himself with the cooking of the Carlton. And thus it was that
Mrs. Luke presently found herself too at the Carlton, for Jocelyn, who
no more than Mr. Thorpe would leave the neighbourhood of Scotland Yard,
was concerned for his mother, left alone at Almond Tree Cottage. So Mr.
Thorpe sent the car back for her, and also for the necessary luggage. He
couldn’t quite see himself appearing next morning at the Carlton in the
dinner-jacket he put on every night at Abergeldie because of the butler.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>She arrived at one in the morning. Mr. Thorpe by that time had taken
three bedrooms, and a sitting-room.</p>

<p>‘I can’t pay,’ said the unhappy Jocelyn on seeing these arrangements.</p>

<p>‘But I can,’ said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know why&mdash;&mdash;’ began Jocelyn, shrinking under the accumulating
weight of obligations.</p>

<p>‘But <i>I</i> do,’ said Mr. Thorpe, cutting him short.</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke never forgot that pink sitting-room at the Carlton, for it was
there that Jocelyn, walking up and down it practically demented, cast
himself adrift from her for ever. And yet what had she done but try to
help him? What had she ever done all his life but love him, and try to
help him?</p>

<p>‘There’s been too much of that&mdash;there’s been too<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_287">{287}</a></span> <i>much</i> of that,’
Jocelyn raved, when she attempted, faintly, for she was exhausted, to
defend herself.</p>

<p>She soon gave up. She soon said nothing more at all, but sat crying
softly, the tears dropping unnoticed on her folded hands.</p>

<p>Before this, however, while the car was fetching her from South Winch,
Mr. Thorpe, bracing himself to his plain and unshirkable duty, invited
Jocelyn into the sitting-room he had engaged, and ordered whiskies and
sodas. These he drank by himself, while Jocelyn, his head sunk on his
chest, sat stretched full length in a low chair staring at nothing; and
having drunk the whiskies, Mr. Thorpe felt able to perform his duty.</p>

<p>Which he did; and in a series of brief sentences described the girl’s
state of mind when he accidentally found her down by his fence, and how
it was the idea of being left alone with Jocelyn’s mother till the
summer that she couldn’t stand, because she simply couldn’t stand his
mother. Frightened of her. Scared stiff. Just simply couldn’t stand her.</p>

<p>At this Jocelyn, roused from his stupor, looked round at Mr. Thorpe with
heavy-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t stand my mother?’ he said in tones of wonder, his mouth
remaining open, so much was he surprised.</p>

<p>‘That’s the ticket,’ said Mr. Thorpe; and drank more whiskey.</p>

<p>He then, after explaining that he wasn’t an orator, told Jocelyn in a
further series of brief sentences that it was unnatural for wives to
live with their mothers-in-law instead of with their husbands, that his
wife knew and felt this, and that she was, besides, having been brought
up on the Bible and being otherwise ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_288">{288}</a></span> life, genuinely and
deeply shocked at what she regarded as his disobedience to God’s laws.</p>

<p>‘But my mother,’ said Jocelyn, ‘has been nothing but&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Sees red about your mother, that girl does,’ interrupted Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>‘But <i>why</i>?’ said Jocelyn, sitting up straight now, his brows knitted in
the most painful bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘Don’t ask <i>me</i>,’ said Mr. Thorpe; and drank more whiskey.</p>

<p>He then told Jocelyn, in a third and last series of brief sentences, for
after that not only had he said his say but the young man didn’t seem
able to stand any more, that if&mdash;no, when&mdash;his wife was restored to him,
he had better see to it that his mother was as far off and as
permanently off as possible; and then, Jocelyn by this time looking the
very image of wretchedness, he gave him, poor young devil, the bit of
comfort of telling him that his wife had only meant to leave him till
she knew he was in Cambridge, and that then she had been going to join
him there, and live in some rooms somewhere near him. It wasn’t him she
was running from, it was his mother.</p>

<p>‘All that girl asked,’ said Mr. Thorpe, bringing his fist, weighty now
with whiskey, down shatteringly on the table, ‘was a couple of rooms,
and you sometimes in them. A girl in a thousand. If she’d been as ugly
as sin she’d still have been a treasure to any man. But look at
her&mdash;<i>look</i> at her, I say.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, damn you!’ shouted Jocelyn, springing to his feet, unable to bear
any more, ‘Damn you&mdash;damn you! How dare you, how dare you, when it’s
you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he came towards Mr. Thorpe, his arms lifted as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_289">{289}</a></span> if to strike him;
but he suddenly dropped them to his sides, and turning away gripped hold
of the chimneypiece, and, laying his head on his hands, sobbed.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Charles Moulsford, then, was right, and the Lukes suffered. So did Mr.
Thorpe, for it was all his fault really. He was amazed at the ease and
swiftness with which he had slipped away from being evidently and
positively a decent man into being equally evidently and positively an
evil-doer. That he had done evil, and perhaps irreparable evil, was
plain. Yet its beginning was after all quite small. He had only helped
the girl to go to her father. Such an act hadn’t deserved this
tremendous punishment. Mr. Thorpe couldn’t help feeling that fate was
behaving unfairly by him. If all his impulses and indiscretions
throughout his life had been punished like this, where would he have
been by now?</p>

<p>But that was neither here nor there. This terrible thing had happened,
and it was his fault. Without him she couldn’t have budged; and, weighed
down by his direct responsibility, when Jocelyn advanced on him with his
fists uplifted ready to strike him he rather hoped he would actually do
it, and when instead the poor devil broke down and began to cry, Mr.
Thorpe was very unhappy indeed. Perhaps he hadn’t been quite tactful in
the things he had said to him. Perhaps he had been clumsy. Whiskey was
tricky stuff. He had only meant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then Margery arrived, with her white face and great, scared eyes, and
found her son standing there holding on to the chimneypiece and crying,
and&mdash;well, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_290">{290}</a></span> Thorpe felt he had overdone the getting even business
altogether, and discovered with a shock that he could no longer regard
himself as a decent man.</p>

<p>He went away to his bedroom, leaving them alone. He didn’t know what
they were saying to each other, but he could hear that Jocelyn seemed to
be talking a good deal. Couldn’t stop, the poor devil couldn’t; went on
and on.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe sat down to think out plans, the ceaseless sound of that
voice in his ears. It was he who had lost the girl, and it was he who
was going to find her. If Scotland Yard found her first so much the
better, but he wasn’t going to sit still till they did, he was going off
on his own account next morning. He’d begin by sending Margery home, who
was doing no good here, he could tell by the sounds coming through the
door, pack Jocelyn, who was doing no good here either raving like that,
off to Cambridge because of the remote chance that the girl was going to
be able after all to do what she said and join him there, and he himself
would meanwhile make a bee-line for her father.</p>

<p>Pinner was the man. Pinner was the point to start from. Pinner and
Woodles. She had said his name was Pinner, and that he lived at Woodles.
Woodles? Funny sort of name that, thought Mr. Thorpe, trying to cheer
himself up by being amused at it. The sounds coming through the door
weren’t very cheering. Raving, the poor young devil was,&mdash;raving at his
mother. Mr. Thorpe feared he had perhaps been quite beastly tactless,
telling him of Sally’s not being able to stand his mother. He felt very
uncomfortable about it, sitting there with those sounds in his ears. And
meanwhile the night was slipping along, and where was that girl?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_291">{291}</a></span></p>

<p>There were so many possible answers to this question, and all of them so
very unpleasant, that Mr. Thorpe couldn’t, he found, sit quiet in his
chair. Three o’clock. Fourteen hours now since last she was seen....</p>

<p>He got up and walked about. In the next room he could hear Jocelyn doing
the same thing. No&mdash;dash it all, thought Mr. Thorpe after listening for
some time to the ceaseless voice, he couldn’t be allowed to go on at his
mother like that. He’d had close on a couple of hours of it. All very
well being heartbroken, all very well being out of one’s senses, but he
couldn’t be allowed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe opened the door and went in. There was Jocelyn, striding
about the room, up and down, round and round, enough to make one giddy
just to see him, his words pouring out, his face convulsed, and there
sitting looking at him, not saying a word, with tears rolling down her
face, was his mother.</p>

<p>No&mdash;damn it all&mdash;there were limits&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Better shut up now, eh?’ said Mr. Thorpe firmly to the demented young
man. ‘Said all there’s to say long ago, I bet. Won’t help, you
know&mdash;this sort of thing.’</p>

<p>‘I’m telling my mother&mdash;I’m making it clear to her once and for all,’
raved Jocelyn, who indeed no longer had the least control of himself,
‘that if I ever find Sally never again as long as I <i>live</i> shall she
come between us, never shall she set <i>foot</i>&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh, shut up. We know all that, don’t we, Margery. Who’s going to come
between you, you silly young ass? Look here&mdash;no good crying, you know,’
said Mr. Thorpe, going to Mrs. Luke and putting his arm round her. It
seemed natural. For two pins he would have kissed her. Habit. Can’t get
away from habits.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Luke didn’t appear to know he was there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_292">{292}</a></span> Her eyes, from which
the tears dropped slowly and unnoticed, were fixed only on Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘He’s so tired&mdash;so tired,’ she kept on whispering to herself. ‘Oh, my
darling&mdash;you’re so <i>tired</i>.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>It was Mr. Pinner’s turn next day to have a bad time, and he had it. He
had a most miserable day, from noon on, when the same car that had
brought Sally drew up in front of his shop, and a stout elderly
gentleman with a red face and a bristly moustache got out, and came and
spent half an hour with him.</p>

<p>What a half hour that was; but all of a piece with the life he seemed
now to be living. The day before there had been first Sally, and then
Mr. Luke, and now there was this gentleman. Mr. Luke had soon been
pacified, and only wanted to be getting home again, but the stout
gentleman came in and sat down square to it, and at the end of half an
hour Mr. Pinner felt as if he had been turned inside out, and wouldn’t
ever be able to look himself in the face again.</p>

<p>For Sally hadn’t gone home, and it was his fault that she hadn’t. These
were the facts; the gentleman said so. Terrible, terrible, thought Mr.
Pinner, shrinking further than ever into his trousers. The first fact
was terrible enough, but the second seemed even worse to Mr. Pinner.
Responsibility, again&mdash;and he who had supposed when he got Sally safely
married that he had done with it for good and all!</p>

<p>At first he had tried to make a stand and hold up his head, and had said
politely&mdash;nothing lost by manners,&mdash;‘Excuse me, sir, but are you by any
chance the gentleman my daughter mentioned to me as ’er father-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_293">{293}</a></span>in-law?’
And when the gentleman, after a minute, said he was, Mr. Pinner told him
that in that case it was he who was responsible for her loss, for it was
he who had lent her the car in which she had left her husband.</p>

<p>Wasn’t this true? Anybody would have thought so; but before Mr. Pinner
could say knife the boot had been put on the other leg, and he found
that it was his fault and his only that she was lost, because he hadn’t,
as the gentleman said was his plain duty, taken her back himself to the
very door.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner, constitutionally unable not to feel guilty if anybody told
him loud enough that he was, at once saw the truth of this. Terrible.
Awful. Fancy. Yes, indeed&mdash;a daughter like that. Yes, indeed&mdash;<i>any</i>
daughter, but a daughter like that, a daughter in a million. No,
indeed&mdash;he didn’t know how he came not to do such a thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And the more Mr. Thorpe cross-examined him about the details of that
seeing-off at the station, the more did Mr. Pinner’s conduct appear
criminal; for, under Mr. Thorpe’s searching questions, Mr. Pinner
somehow began to be sure the lady in the carriage hadn’t been a lady at
all, but something quite different, something terrible and wicked, who
had carried Sally off into the sort of place one doesn’t mention. He
remembered her black eyes, and how they rolled&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Rolled, eh?’ said Mr. Thorpe, who was snatching at Mr. Pinner’s words
almost before they appeared, trembling, on the edge of his mouth.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;rolled. And bold-looking, she was too,&mdash;bold-looking, and pat as
you please at answering. Not Mr. Pinner’s idea at all of a modest woman.
Yes, and the compartment smelt of scent, now he came to think of
it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_294">{294}</a></span>&mdash;yes, he dared say it was cheap scent. And powdered, her face
was&mdash;he had remarked on it to himself, after the train had gone.</p>

<p>Thus did Mr. Thorpe’s own fears get by cross-examination into Mr.
Pinner’s mind, and by the end of the half hour Mr. Pinner was as much
convinced as Mr. Thorpe that Sally had fallen into the hands of somebody
of whom Mr. Thorpe used an expression that Mr. Pinner wouldn’t have
soiled his lips with for any sum one cared to mention. And then, after
swearing at him, and asking him what sort of a father he thought he was,
and Mr. Pinner, who by this time was wishing with all his heart that he
wasn’t a father at all, tremblingly begging him not to blaspheme, Mr.
Thorpe went away.</p>

<p>‘What ’ad I better do now, sir?’ Mr. Pinner asked, following him out on
to the steps in much distress, clinging to him in spite of his
horrifying language.</p>

<p>‘You? What can <i>you</i> do? You’ve done your damnedest&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Sir, sir&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he got into his car, and Mr. Pinner heard him tell the chauffeur to
drive like the devil to London and go to Liverpool Street Station; and
it seemed as if in a flash the street were empty, and he alone.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Pinner himself arrived at Liverpool Street
Station&mdash;an anxious little man in his Sunday clothes, his blue eyes
staring with anxiety. He couldn’t just stay in his shop, and as likely
as not never hear anything more, either one way or the other. He must do
something. He must ask questions. Nobody would tell him if Sally were
found or not, if he didn’t. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_295">{295}</a></span> herself might some day perhaps drop him
a line, but she wasn’t much of a one for writing, and besides he had
been harsh to her. ‘Don’t believe you loves me,’ she had said, crying
bitterly when he scolded her so and wouldn’t let her stay with him. Love
her? He loved her dearly. She was all he had in the world. If anything
had happened to that girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He timidly stopped a porter, and began to inquire. The porter, who was
busy, stared at him and hurried on. He then tried a guard, who said,
‘Eh?’ very loud, looked past him along the platform, waved a green flag,
jumped on to a train, and departed.</p>

<p>He then tried another porter; several porters; and at last, more timid
than ever by this time, approached a ticket-collector.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to have time for Mr. Pinner. His trousers were against
him. So was his hat; so was everything he said and did. The
ticket-collector, who didn’t like shabbiness and meekness, ignored him.
He knew perfectly well who Mr. Pinner was talking about, for the whole
station was invariably aware of any of the Duke’s family passing through
it, and everybody the day before had seen Lady Laura and the young lady.
Mr. Pinner hadn’t got beyond his first words of description before the
ticket-collector knew what he was driving at, but he only looked down
his long nose at the flushed little man in the corkscrew trousers, and
said nothing. Give a thing like that information about her ladyship’s
movements? Not much.</p>

<p>Yet this same ticket-collector, only an hour or two before, had been wax
in the gloved hands of Mr. Thorpe, and with these words had parted from
him:</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir. Don’t mention it, sir. No trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_296">{296}</a></span> at all. Yes&mdash;a very
striking young lady indeed, sir. Her ladyship was going to Goring House
for a couple of days, so the chauffeur told me. Much obliged, sir. Yes,
sir&mdash;Lady Laura Moulsford. That’s right, sir&mdash;the Duke of Goring’s
daughter.’</p>

<p>This same ticket-collector had said all that; and to Mr. Pinner he said
not a word. He merely down his long nose looked at him, and when the
little man explained that he was the fair young lady’s father he looked
at him more glassily than ever. So that presently for very shame Mr.
Pinner couldn’t go on standing there asking questions that got no
answers, and after lingering awhile uncertainly in the
ticket-collector’s neighbourhood, for something told him that this man
could throw light on Sally’s disappearance if he would, he went
sorrowfully, but unresentfully, away.</p>

<p>Presently he found himself in South Winch. He seemed to have drifted
there, not knowing what to do or where to go next, and unable to bear
the thought of his lonely shop and of nobody’s letting him know about
anything. He had thought it fine and peaceful at first to be independent
and at last alone, but it didn’t seem so now. He missed his wife. Nobody
now to mind what he did, good or bad. Nobody.</p>

<p>In South Winch he sought out the grocer, so as to get Jocelyn’s address,
preferring him to the Post Office because the smell of currants and
bacon made him feel less lonely, and, having followed the directions the
grocer gave him, found the road and the house, and opened the white gate
with deferential trepidation. Timidly at the door he asked if he might
say a word to Mr. Luke, and the little maid, at once at ease with his
sort of clothes, inquired pleasantly if Mrs. Luke wouldn’t do<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_297">{297}</a></span> just as
well; better, suggested the little maid, because she was there, and Mr.
Jocelyn wasn’t. In fact she offered Mrs. Luke to Mr. Pinner, she pressed
her upon him,&mdash;a lady he wouldn’t have dreamt of disturbing if left to
himself.</p>

<p>So that Mr. Pinner, without apparently in the least wanting to, found
himself in a beautiful drawing-room, and there by the fire sat a lady,
leaning back on some cushions as though she were tired.</p>

<p>At first he thought she was asleep, and he was beginning to feel
extremely awkward when she turned her head and looked at him.</p>

<p>A pale lady. A very pale lady; with a face that seemed all eyes.</p>

<p>‘Beg pardon, mum,’ said Mr. Pinner, wishing he hadn’t come.</p>

<p>The lady went on looking at him. She didn’t move. Her hands were hanging
down over the arms of the chair as though she were tired. She just
turned her head, but didn’t move else.</p>

<p>‘It’s about Sally,’ said Mr. Pinner. ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Appened to be passin’, and
thought I’d&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>He stopped, for now he came to think of it he didn’t rightly know what
he had thought.</p>

<p>The lady leant forward in her chair. ‘Do you know where she is?’ she
asked quickly.</p>

<p>‘No, mum. Do you?’ asked Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said the lady in a queer sort of voice, her head drooping.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinner stood there very awkward indeed.</p>

<p>‘Are you her father?’ she asked, after a minute.</p>

<p>‘That’s right, mum,’ said Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>Then she got up and came across to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_298">{298}</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you are very unhappy,’ she said, looking at him.</p>

<p>‘That’s right, mum,’ said Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>She held out her hand, her eyes on his face.</p>

<p>He shook it respectfully, but without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>‘Why, you’re cold,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘That’s right, mum,’ said Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you come to the fire and get warm?’ she said; and before he had
time to consider what he ought to do next, Mr. Pinner found himself
sitting on the edge of the low chair the lady pushed up for him, warming
his knees and not saying anything.</p>

<p>The lady talked a little. She had some nice hot tea made for him, and
while he drank it talked a little, and said she was sure they would hear
good news soon, and he mustn’t worry, because she was sure....</p>

<p>Then she fell silent too, and they sat there together looking into the
fire; and it was funny, thought Mr. Pinner, how just to sit there
quietly, and know she was sorry too about everything, seemed to make him
feel better. A kind lady; a good lady. What did Sally mean, saying he
wouldn’t be able to stand her either, if he knew her? The only thing
wrong with her that Mr. Pinner could see, was that she looked so ill.
Half dead, thought Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>And after being with her he had more courage to go back to the lonely
shop, and she promised faithfully to let him know the minute there was
any news, and again told him not to worry and everything would come all
right, and he went away comforted.</p>

<p>And she, watching him as he trotted off down to the gate, felt somehow
comforted too; not quite so lonely; not quite so lost.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_299">{299}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Thorpe, having lunched and tidied and generally freshened
himself up, was on the steps of Goring House, asking for Lady Laura
Moulsford.</p>

<p>‘Her ladyship is hout,’ said the footman haughtily, for he knew at once
when Mr. Thorpe added the word Moulsford that he was what the footman
called not one of Our Lot. No good his having a car waiting there, and a
fur coat, and suède gloves; he simply wasn’t one of Our Lot. And the
footman, his head thrown back, looked at Mr. Thorpe very much as the
ticket-collector was at that moment looking at Mr. Pinner.</p>

<p>‘Out, eh?’ said Mr. Thorpe. ‘When will she be in?’</p>

<p>‘Her ladyship didn’t say,’ said the footman, his head well back.</p>

<p>‘You’ve got a young lady here of the name of Luke. She in?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Luke is hout,’ said the footman, beginning to shut the door.</p>

<p>‘Is anybody in?’ asked Mr. Thorpe, getting angry.</p>

<p>‘The family is hout,’ said the footman; and was going to shut the door
quite when Mr. Thorpe went close up to him and damned him. And because
Mr. Thorpe’s temper was quick and hot he damned him thoroughly, and the
footman, as he heard the familiar words, strongly reminiscent not only
of Lord Streatley but also of the different sergeants he had had during
the war, who, however unlike each other to look at, were identical to
listen to, thought he must be one of Lady Laura’s friends after all, and
began to open the door again; and Mr. Thorpe advancing, damning as he
went and saying things about flunkeys that were new to the footman,
entered that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_300">{300}</a></span> marble hall which had struck such a chill into Sally’s
unaspiring soul.</p>

<p>The butler appeared. The butler was suave where the footman had been
haughty. He had heard some of the things Mr. Thorpe was saying as he
hurried from his private sitting-room into the echoing hall, and had no
doubt that he was a friend of the family’s.</p>

<p>Lady Laura had been in to lunch, but had gone out again; Mrs. Luke was
motoring with Lord Charles&mdash;who the devil was <i>he</i>, Mr. Thorpe
wondered&mdash;down to Crippenham, where she was going to stay the night. Her
ladyship had had a telegram from his lordship to that effect, and she
herself was going down the following morning.</p>

<p>‘Where’s Crippenham?’ asked Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p>The butler was surprised. Up to that moment he had taken Mr. Thorpe for
a friend, if an infrequent one, of Lady Laura’s.</p>

<p>‘His Grace’s Cambridgeshire seat,’ he said, in his turn with <i>hauteur</i>.
‘His Grace is at present in residence.’</p>

<p>‘Crikey!’ thought Mr. Thorpe. ‘Got right in with the Duke himself, has
she?’ And he felt fonder of Sally than ever.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>At this point Mr. Thorpe, who had been behaving so well, began to behave
less well. The minute the pressure of anxiety was relaxed, the minute,
that is, that he no longer suffered, he became callous to the sufferings
of the Lukes; and instead of at once letting them know what he had
discovered he kept it to himself, he hugged his secret, and deferred
sending till some hours later a telegram to each of them saying, ‘<i>Hot
on her tracks.</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_301">{301}</a></span>’</p>

<p>Quite enough, thought Mr. Thorpe, as jolly again as a sand-boy, and
immediately unable to imagine the world other than populated by
sand-boys equally jolly,&mdash;quite enough that would be to go on with,
quite enough to make them both feel better. If he told them more, they’d
get rushing off to Crippenham and disturbing the Duke’s house-party. The
whole thing should now be allowed to simmer, said Mr. Thorpe to himself.
Sally should be given a fair field with her duke, and not have relations
coming barging in and interrupting.</p>

<p>But what a girl, thought Mr. Thorpe, slapping his knee&mdash;he was in his
car, on the way to his club&mdash;what a girl. She only had to meet dukes for
them to go down like ninepins at her feet. Apart from her beauty, what
spirit, what daring, what initiative, what resource! It had been worth
all the anxiety, this magnificent <i>dénouement</i>. Safe, and sounder than
ever. A glorious girl; and he too had at once seen how glorious she was,
and at once, like the Duke, fallen at her feet. That girl, thought Mr.
Thorpe, who began to believe she would rise triumphant even over a
handicap like Jocelyn, might do anything, might do any mortal thing,&mdash;no
end at all, there wasn’t, to what that girl couldn’t do. And, glowing,
he telephoned to Scotland Yard, and later on, after having had his tea
and played a rubber of bridge, sent his telegrams.</p>

<p>Then he went quietly home. Things should simmer. Things must now be left
to themselves a little. He went quietly home to Abergeldie, and didn’t
let Mrs. Luke know he was there. Her feelings, he considered, were
sufficiently relieved for the present by his telegram; things must now
be allowed to simmer. And he took a little walk in his shrubbery, and
then had a hot bath,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_302">{302}</a></span> and dressed, and dined, ordering up a pint of the
1911 <i>Cordon Rouge</i>, and sat down afterwards with a great sigh of
satisfaction by his library fire.</p>

<p>He smoked, and he thought; and the only thing he regretted in the whole
business was the rude name he had called Lady Laura Moulsford to that
fool Pinner. But, long as he smoked and thought, it never occurred to
him to resent, or even to criticise, the conduct of the Moulsford
family. Strange as it may seem, considering that family’s black
behaviour, Mr. Thorpe dwelt on it in his mind with nothing but
complacency.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_303">{303}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">At</span> Crippenham next morning it was very fine. London and South Winch were
in a mist, but the sun shone brightly in Cambridgeshire, and the Duke
woke up with a curiously youthful feeling of eagerness to get up quickly
and go downstairs. He knew he couldn’t do anything quickly, but the odd
thing was that for years and years he hadn’t wanted to, and that now
suddenly he did want to; and just to want to was both pleasant and
remarkable.</p>

<p>He had been thinking in the night,&mdash;or, rather, Charles’s thoughts,
placed so insistently before him, had sunk in and become
indistinguishable from his own; and he had thought so much that he
hadn’t gone to sleep till nearly five. But then he slept soundly, and
woke up to find his room flooded with sunshine, and to feel this
curiously agreeable eagerness to be up and doing.</p>

<p>The evening before, when Charles came in from the garden and packed his
bewitching guest off to bed, he had been very cross, and had listened
peevishly to all his son was explaining and pointing out; not because he
wasn’t interested, or because he resented the suggestions being made,
but simply because the moment that girl left the room it was as if the
light had gone out,&mdash;the light, and the fire. She needn’t have obeyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_304">{304}</a></span>
Charles. Why should she obey Charles? She might have stayed with him a
little longer, warming him by the sight of her beauty and her youth. The
instant she went he felt old and cold; back again in the condition he
was in before she arrived, dropped back again into age and listlessness,
and, however stoutly he pretended it wasn’t so, into a deathly chill.</p>

<p>Now that, thought the Duke, himself surprised at the difference his
guest’s not being in the room made, was what had happened to David too
towards the end. They didn’t read it in the Lessons in church on
Sundays, but he nevertheless quite well remembered, from his private
inquisitive study of the Bible in his boyhood, how they covered David
when he was old with clothes but he got no heat, and only a young person
called the Shunammite was able, by her near presence, to warm him. The
Duke didn’t ask such nearness as had been the Shunammite’s to David, for
he, perhaps because he was less old, found all he needed of renewed life
by merely looking at Sally; but he did, remembering David while Charles
talked, feel aggrieved that so little as this, so little as merely
wishing to look at her, should be taken from him, and she sent to bed at
ten o’clock.</p>

<p>So he was cross, and pretended not to understand, and anyhow not to be
interested. But he had understood very well, and in the watches of the
night had come to his decision. At his age it wouldn’t do to be too long
coming to decisions; if he wished to secure the beautiful young
creature&mdash;Charles said help, but does not helping, by means of the
resultant obligations, also secure?&mdash;he must be quick.</p>

<p>He rang for his servant half an hour before the usual time. He wanted to
get up, to go to her again, to look<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_305">{305}</a></span> at her, to sit near her and have
her fragrant, lovely youth flowing round him. The mere thought of Sally
made him feel happier and more awake than he had felt for years. Better
than the fortnight’s cure of silence and diet at Crippenham was one look
at Sally, one minute spent with Sally. And she was so kind and
intelligent, as well as so beautiful&mdash;listening to every word he said
with the most obvious interest, and not once fidgeting or getting
sleepy, as people nowadays seemed to have got into the habit of doing.
It was like sitting in the sun to be with her; like sitting in the sun
on a warm spring morning, and freshness everywhere, and flowers, and
hope.</p>

<p>Naturally, having found this draught of new life the Duke wasn’t going
to let it go. On the contrary, it was his firm intention, with all the
strength and obstinacy still in him, to stick to Sally. How fortunate
that she was poor, and he could be the one to help her. For she, owing
all her happiness to him, couldn’t but let him often be with her.
Charles had said it would be both new and desirable to do something in
one’s life for nothing; but the Duke doubted if it were ever possible,
however much one wished to, to do anything for nothing. In the case of
Sally it was manifestly impossible. Whatever he did, whatever he gave,
he would be getting far more back; for she by her friendship, and
perhaps affection, and anyhow by her presence, would be giving him life.</p>

<p>‘Come out into the garden, my dear,’ he said, when he had been safely
helped downstairs&mdash;the stairs were each time an adventure&mdash;putting his
shaking hand through her arm. ‘I want to see your hair in the sun, while
I talk to you.’</p>

<p>And leading him carefully out, Sally thought, ‘Poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_306">{306}</a></span> old gentleman,’ and
minded nothing at all that he said. Her hair, her eyes, all that <i>Oh my
ain’t you beautiful</i> business, of which she was otherwise both sick and
afraid, didn’t matter in him she called the Jewk. He was just a poor old
gentleman, an ancient and practically helpless baby, towards whom she
felt like a compassionate mother; and when he said, sitting in the sunny
sheltered seat she had lowered him on to and taking her hand and looking
at her with his watery old eyes, that he was going to give her
Crippenham, and that the only condition he made was that he might come
and do a rest-cure there rather often, she smiled and nodded as sweetly
and kindly as she smiled and nodded at everything else he said.</p>

<p>Like the croonings of a baby were the utterances of the Duke in Sally’s
ears; no more meaning in them, no more weight to be attached to them,
than that. Give her Crippenham? Poor old gentleman. Didn’t know what he
was talking about any more, poor old dear. She humoured him; she patted
his arm; and she wished to goodness Laura would be quick and come and
take her to her husband.</p>

<p>Sally now longed to get to Jocelyn as much as if she had passionately
loved him. He was her husband. He was the father of the little baby. Her
place was with him. She had had enough of this fleshpot business. She
was homesick for the things she knew,&mdash;plain things, simple things,
duties she understood. Kind, yes; kind as kind, the picks were, and they
meant well; but she had had enough. It wasn’t right it wasn’t, at least
it wasn’t right for her, to live so fat. What would her father have said
if he had seen her in the night in Laura’s bedroom, among all that lot
of silver bottles and brushes<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_307">{307}</a></span> and laces and silks, and herself in a
thin silk nightgown the colour of skin, making her look stark naked?
What would he have said if he had seen her having her breakfast up there
as though she were ill,&mdash;and such a breakfast, too! Fleshpots, he’d have
said; fleshpots. And he would have said, Sally, strong if inaccurate in
her Bible, was sure, that she had sold her husband for a mess of
fleshpots.</p>

<p>This was no life for her, this was no place for her, she thought, her
head bowed and the sun playing at games of miracles with her hair while
the Duke talked. She drew impatient patterns with the tip of her shoe on
the gravel. She hardly listened. Her ear was cocked for the first sounds
of Laura. She ached to have done with all this wasting of time, she
ached to be in her own home, getting on with her job of looking after
her man and preparing for her child. ‘Saturday today,’ she mused, such a
lovely look coming into her eyes that the Duke, watching her, was sure
it was his proposed gift making her divinely happy. ‘We’d be ’avin’
shepherd’s pie for dinner&mdash;or p’raps a nice little bit of fish....’</p>

<p>And, coming out of that pleasant dream with a sigh, she thought,
‘Oughtn’t never to ’ave met none of these ’ere. All comes of runnin’
away from dooty.’</p>

<p>Apologetically she turned her head and looked at the Duke, for she had
forgotten him for a moment, besides having been thinking on lines that
were hardly grateful. Poor old gentleman&mdash;still keeping on about giving
her Crippenham. Crippenham? She’d as soon have the cleaning of
Buckingham Palace while she was about it as of that great, frightening
house&mdash;or, come to that, of a prison.</p>

<p>But how like a bad dream it was, being kept there with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_308">{308}</a></span> the morning
slipping past, and she unable to reach him across the gulf of his
deafness. By eleven o’clock she was quite pale with unhappiness, she
could hardly bear it any longer. Would she have to give manners the
go-by and take to her heels once more? This time, though, there would be
no kind father-in-law to lend her a car; this time she would have to
walk,&mdash;walk all the way, and then when she got there find Jocelyn
unaided. And the old gentleman kept on and on about Crippenham being
hers, and everything in it....</p>

<p>’E’s nothin’ but a nimage,’ she said to herself in despair. ‘Sits ’ere
like a old idol. Wot do <i>’e</i> know about a married woman’s dooties?’</p>

<p>‘Where’s Charles?’ asked the Duke.</p>

<p>Sally shook her head. She hadn’t seen a sign of him that morning.</p>

<p>‘I want him to get my solicitor down&mdash;no time to lose,’ said the Duke.
‘You’re to have the place lock, stock and barrel, my dear, such as it
is&mdash;servants and all.’</p>

<p>Servants and all? Poor old gentleman. Why, she wouldn’t know which end
of a servant to start with. She with servants? And these ones here who,
however hard she tried up there in the bedroom, wouldn’t make friends.
They called her Madam. She Madam? Oh, my gracious, thought Sally,
shrinking in horror from such a dreadful picture.</p>

<p>‘It’s a hole of a place,’ went on the Duke, ‘and quite unworthy of you,
but we can have more bathrooms put in, and it’ll do till we find
something you like better. And Charles tells me you married rather
suddenly, and haven’t got anywhere to go to at present. He also says you
have to live close to Cambridge, because of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_309">{309}</a></span> husband’s studies. And
he also says, and I entirely agree with him, my dear, that you oughtn’t
to be in Cambridge itself, but somewhere more secluded&mdash;somewhere where
you won’t be seen quite so much, somewhere hidden, in fact. Now I think,
I really do think, that Crippenham, in spite of all its disadvantages,
does exactly fulfil these requirements. And I want you to have it, my
dear&mdash;to take it as my wedding present to you, and to live in it very
happily, and bless it and make it beautiful by your presence.’</p>

<p>Thus the Duke.</p>

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>E don’t ’alf <i>talk</i>,’ thought Sally, quivering to be gone.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Charles, on being sent for by the Duke, was nowhere to be found. That
was because he was in South Winch. He had gone off at daybreak in his
car, and at the very moment his father woke up to the fact of his
absence and asked where he was, he was standing in the drawing-room at
Almond Tree Cottage, his eyes fixed eagerly on the door, waiting for
Mrs. Luke.</p>

<p>He hadn’t been able to sleep for thinking of her. Somehow he had got it
into his head that she, more than her son, would suffer through Sally’s
disappearance, and be afraid. Because, thought Charles, she would feel
that it was from her the girl had run, and that any misfortune that
might happen to her would be, terribly, laid at her door. For two whole
days and two whole nights that unfortunate woman must have gone through
torture. What Charles couldn’t understand was why he hadn’t thought of
this before. Indeed his and Laura’s conduct had been utterly
unpardonable. The least he could now do, he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_310">{310}</a></span> as he lay wide
awake throughout the night, was to get to South Winch without losing a
minute, and put Mrs. Luke out of her misery, and beg her forgiveness.</p>

<p>She was in the garden when he arrived. The little maid, staring at the
card he asked her to take to her mistress, said she would fetch her, and
ushered him into the drawing-room, where he waited with the books, the
bright cushions, the Tiepolo, and two withered tulips in a glass from
which nearly all the water had dried away; and while he waited he fought
with a feeling he considered most contemptible, in face of the facts,
that he was somehow on an errand of mercy, and arriving with healing in
his wings,&mdash;that he was somehow a benefactor.</p>

<p>Sternly he told himself he ought to feel nothing but shame; sternly he
tried to suppress his glow of misplaced self-satisfaction. There was
nothing good about him and Laura in this business. They had, the pair of
them, been criminally impulsive and selfish. He knew it; he acknowledged
it. Yet here he was, secretly glowing, his eyes watching the door, as
much excited as if he were going to bestow a most magnificently
generous, unexpected present.</p>

<p>Then it opened, and Mrs. Luke came in. He was sure it was Mrs. Luke, for
no one else could look so unhappy; and the glow utterly vanished, and
the feeling of shame and contrition became overwhelming.</p>

<p>‘She’s safe,’ said Charles quickly, eager to put a stop at once to the
expression in her eyes. ‘She’s at my father’s. She’s going to Cambridge
today to your son. She’s been with us the whole time&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And he went to her, and took her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>‘If it weren’t so ridiculous,’ he said, his face flushed with painful
contrition, still holding her hand and looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_311">{311}</a></span> into her heavy,
dark-ringed eyes, ‘I’d very much like to go down on my knees to you, and
beg your pardon.’</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>And while Charles was in South Winch, Laura was in Cambridge, dealing
with Jocelyn. She, like Charles, had become conscious of the sufferings
of the Lukes, and, like him, was obsessed by them and lost in
astonishment that she hadn’t thought of them sooner; but for some
obscure reason, or instinct, her compunctions and her sympathies were
for Jocelyn rather than for his mother, and after a second sleepless
night, during which she was haunted by the image of the unfortunate
young husband and greatly tormented, she went down, much chastened, to
Cambridge by the first possible train, with only one desire now, to put
him out of his misery and beg his forgiveness.</p>

<p>So that Jocelyn, sitting doing nothing, his untouched breakfast still
littering the table, sitting bent forward in the basket-chair common to
the rooms of young men at Cambridge, his thin hands gripped so hard
round his knees that the knuckles showed white, his ears strained for
the slightest sound on the staircase, his eyes hollow from want of
sleep, sitting as he had sat all the previous afternoon after getting
Mr. Thorpe’s telegram and most of the night, sitting waiting, listening,
and perhaps for the first time in his life, for his mother had not
included religious exercises in his early education, doing something not
unlike praying, did at last hear a woman’s step crossing Austen’s Court,
hesitating at what he felt sure was his corner, then slowly coming up
his staircase, and hesitating again at the first floor.</p>

<p>All the blood in his body seemed to rush to his head<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_312">{312}</a></span> and throb there.
His heart thumped so loud that he could hardly hear the steps any more.
He struggled out of his low chair and stood listening, holding on to it
to steady himself. Would they come up higher? Yes&mdash;they were coming up.
Yes&mdash;it must be Sally. Sally&mdash;oh, oh, <i>Sally</i>!</p>

<p>He flew to the door, pulled it open, and saw&mdash;Laura.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right,’ she panted, for the stairs were steep and she was fat,
‘it is&mdash;about Sally&mdash;don’t look so&mdash;&mdash;’ she stopped to get her
breath&mdash;‘so dreadfully disappointed. She’s safe. If you’ll&mdash;oh, what
<i>stairs</i>&mdash;&mdash;’ she pressed her hand to her heaving bosom&mdash;‘come with me,
I’ll&mdash;take you&mdash;to her&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And having got to the top, she staggered past him into his room, and
dropped into the basket-chair, and for a minute or two did nothing but
gasp.</p>

<p>But how difficult she found him. Jocelyn, whose reactions were always
violent, behaved very differently from the way his mother at that moment
was behaving, placed in the same situation of being asked forgiveness by
a Moulsford. Instead of forgiving, of being, as Laura had pictured, so
much delighted at the prospect of soon having Sally restored to him that
he didn’t mind anything, he appeared to mind very much, and quarrelled
with her. She, accustomed to have everything she did that was perhaps a
little wrong condoned and overlooked by all classes except her own, was
astonished. Here she was, doing a thing she had never done before,
begging a young man to forgive her, and he wouldn’t. On the contrary, he
rated her. Rated her! Her, Laura Moulsford. She knew that much is
forgiven those above by those below, and had frequently deplored the
practice as one that has sometimes held up progress, but now<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_313">{313}</a></span> that the
opposite was being done to herself she didn’t like it at all.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a nasty disposition you’ve got!’ she cried at last, when
Jocelyn had been telling her for ten impassioned minutes, leaning
against the chimney-piece and glowering down at her with eyes flashing
with indignation, what he thought of her. ‘I’m glad now, instead of
sorry, for what I did. At least Sally has had two days less of you.’</p>

<p>‘If you’re going to rag me as well&mdash;&mdash;’ began Jocelyn, taking a quick
step forward as if to seize and shake this fat little incredibly
officious stranger,&mdash;so like him, his mother would have said, to waste
time being furious instead of at once making her take him to Sally.</p>

<p>But Laura, unacquainted with his ways, was astonished.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself up. ‘It’s not you I’m cursing really at all,’ he
said. ‘It’s myself.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t mind that,’ said Laura, smiling.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got the beastliest temper,’ said Jocelyn.</p>

<p>‘So I see,’ said Laura.</p>

<p>‘Do you think,’ he asked, for in spite of his anger he was all soft and
bruised underneath after his two days of fear, and when the fat stranger
smiled there was something very motherly about her, ‘I shall ever get
over it?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps if you try&mdash;try hard.’</p>

<p>‘But&mdash;look here, I don’t care what you say&mdash;what <i>business</i> had you to
make away with my wife?’</p>

<p>‘Now you’re beginning all over again.’</p>

<p>‘Make away with my wife, smash up everything between me and my
mother&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>oh</i>&mdash;&mdash;’ interrupted Laura, stopping up her ears, and bowing her
head before the storm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_314">{314}</a></span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>It was ten more minutes before she got him out of his rooms and into a
taxi.</p>

<p>‘We’ve lost twenty minutes,’ she said, looking at her watch. ‘You’ve
lost twenty kisses you might have had&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘For God’s <i>sake</i> don’t rag me!’ cried Jocelyn, gripping her by the arm
and bundling her into the taxi.</p>

<p>‘But what,’ asked Laura, who had tumbled in a heap on the seat, yet who
didn’t mind being thrown in because she knew she deserved worse than
that, ‘what else can one do with a creature like you?’</p>

<p>And she told him very seriously, as they heaved along towards
Crippenham, that the real mistake had been Sally’s marrying beneath her.</p>

<p>‘Beneath her?’ repeated Jocelyn, staring.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it apparent?’ said Laura. ‘Angels should only marry other angels,
and not descend to entanglements with perfectly ordinary&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m damned if I’m ordinary,’ thought Jocelyn. ‘And who the devil is
<i>she</i>, anyhow?’</p>

<p>‘Bad-tempered,’ continued Laura.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’m beastly bad-tempered,’ he admitted.</p>

<p>‘Conceited&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I swear I’m not conceited,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you?’ said Laura, turning her head and scrutinising him with
bright, mocking eyes.</p>

<p>And then, coming swift and silent as an arrow along the road towards
their taxi, she saw her father’s car.</p>

<p>‘Oh, stop!’ she cried, leaping to her feet and thrusting as much of
herself as would go through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_315">{315}</a></span> window. ‘Here’s my father&mdash;yes, and
Sally. Stop&mdash;oh, <i>stop</i>!’ she cried, frantically waving her arms.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>It had been decreed by Fate that Jocelyn should be reunited to Sally in
the middle of the road just beyond Waterbeach, at the point where the
lane to Lyddiatt’s Farm turns off; for such was the Duke’s desire to
help his lovely friend and such his infatuation, that he had actually
broken his rule of never emerging from Crippenham, once he got there,
till the day appointed for his departure, and was himself taking her to
Ananias to hand her over in person to her husband, afterwards lunching
with the Master,&mdash;a thing unheard of, this lunching, for the Duke
disliked the Master’s politics and the Master disliked the Duke’s, but
what wouldn’t one do to further the interests, by saying a good word for
them, of the young couple?</p>

<p>This he had arranged that morning before coming downstairs, his amazed
servant telephoning the message and receiving the Master’s hypocritical
expressions of pleasure in return, for apart from the Duke’s politics
the Master was no fonder of a deaf guest than anybody else; and just as
Sally, on that garden seat, was coming to the end of her patience and
submissiveness and was seriously thinking of jumping up and taking to
her heels, the parlourmaid appeared on the path; and when she was quite
close she stood still, and opened her mouth very wide, and roared out
that the car was at the door; and the Duke, with a final pat of
benediction, bade Sally fetch her hat, and come with him to her husband.</p>

<p>So there it was that they met,&mdash;the taxi and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_316">{316}</a></span> Rolls Royce, Laura and
Jocelyn, Sally and the Duke. And on the Swaffham Prior side of
Waterbeach, where the crooked signpost points to Lyddiatt’s Farm, the
dull, empty road was made radiant for a moment that day by happiness.</p>

<p>‘Stop! Stop!’ cried Laura, frantically waving.</p>

<p>‘Sally! Oh&mdash;oh, <i>Sally</i>!’ shouted Jocelyn, standing up too, and trying
too, behind Laura, to wave.</p>

<p>The chauffeur recognised Laura, and pulled up as soon as he could; the
taxi pulled up with a great grinding of its brakes; Jocelyn jumped out
of one door, and Laura of the other; and both ran.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said Sally, who didn’t know what had happened, turning her head
and looking in astonishment at the two running figures coming along
behind, ‘why,’ she said, forgetting the Duke was deaf, ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>ere <i>is</i> Mr.
Luke&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And in another instant Jocelyn was there, up on the step of the car,
leaning over the side, dragging her to him with both arms, hugging her
to his heart, and kissing her as if there were no one in the world
except themselves.</p>

<p>‘Sally&mdash;oh, my <i>darling</i>! Oh, Sally&mdash;oh, oh, <i>Sally</i>!’ cried Jocelyn,
raining kisses on her between each word. ‘How could you&mdash;why did
you&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;I know, I know&mdash;I’ve been a beast to you&mdash;but I’m not
going to be any more&mdash;I swear, I swear&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Now don’t, Mr Luke,’ Sally managed to say, stifled though she was,
‘don’t get swearin’ about it&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>And pulling her head away from him she was able to attend to the
proprieties, and introduce him.</p>

<p>‘My ’usband,’ introduced Sally, looking over his arm, which was round
her neck, at the old man beside<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_317">{317}</a></span> her. ‘The Jewk,’ she said, turning her
face back to Jocelyn, who took no notice of the introduction, who didn’t
indeed hear, because the moment she turned her face&mdash;oh, her divine,
divine little face!&mdash;back to him, he fell to kissing it again.</p>

<p>And Laura, coming panting up just then, got up on the step on the other
side of the car, and shouted in her father’s ear, who could always hear
everything she said, ‘This is Jocelyn Luke, Father&mdash;Sally’s husband.’</p>

<p>And the Duke said, ‘I thought it must be.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_318">{318}</a></span>’</p>

<h2><a id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<h3>§</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Now</span> the end of this story, which is only the very beginning of Sally,
the merest introduction to her, for it isn’t to be supposed that nothing
more happened in her life,&mdash;the end of it is that she did as she was
told about Crippenham, and if the Duke had been less than ninety-three
there would have been a scandal.</p>

<p>But after ninety there is little scandal. The worst that was said of the
Lukes was that they had got hold of the old man, and nobody who saw
Sally believed that. Indeed, the instant anyone set eyes on her the
Duke’s behaviour was accounted for, and after five minutes in her
company it became crystal clear that she was incapable of getting hold
of anybody. So young, so shy, so acquiescent,&mdash;absurd to suppose she
ever had such a thing as an ulterior motive. And the husband, too;
impossible to imagine that silent scholar, also so young, and rather shy
too, or else very sulky,&mdash;impossible to imagine him plotting. On the
contrary, he didn’t seem to like what had happened to him much, and
showed no signs whatever either of pleasure or gratitude. But of Jocelyn
no one thought long. He was without interest for the great world. He was
merely an obscure young man at Cambridge, somebody the Duke’s amazing
beauty had married.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_319">{319}</a></span></p>

<p>Sally did, then, as she was told about Crippenham. It was given her, and
she took it; or rather, for her attitude was one of complete passivity,
it became hers. But she had an unsuspected simple tenacity of purpose,
which was later to develop disconcertingly, and she refused to live
anywhere except in the four-roomed cottage in the corner of the garden,
built years before as a playhouse for Laura and Charles.</p>

<p>On this one point she was like a rock; a polite rock, against which
persuasions, though received sweetly and amiably, should beat in vain.
So the Duke had the little house fitted up with every known
labour-saving appliance, none of which Sally would use because of having
been brought up to believe only in elbow-grease, and two bathrooms, one
for her and one for Jocelyn; and he attached such importance to these
bathrooms, and he insisted so obstinately on their being built, that
Sally could only conclude the picks must need a terrible lot of washing.
Whited sepulchres they must be, she secretly thought; looking as clean
as clean outside, fit to eat one’s dinner off if it came to that, but
evidently nothing but show and take-in.</p>

<p>The Duke, much concerned at first, settled down to this determination of
Sally’s, and explained it to himself by remembering Marie-Antoinette.
She had her Trianon. She too had played, as Sally wished to play, at
being simple. He consoled himself by speaking of the cottage as Little
Trianon; a name Sally accepted with patience, though she told
Jocelyn&mdash;who was so much stunned at the strange turn his life had taken
that she found she could be quite chatty with him, and he never
corrected, and never even said anything back&mdash;she wouldn’t have thought
of herself. Some day, the Duke was sure, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_320">{320}</a></span> marvellous child would
grow up and get tired of her Trianon, and then, when she wanted to move
into the house, she should find Versailles all ready for her, and very
different from what it used to be.</p>

<p>So, on the excuse of seeing to the alterations, he was hardly ever away
from Crippenham, and if he had been less than ninety-three there would
certainly have been a scandal.</p>

<p>But Jocelyn, who woke up after the wild joy and relief of being reunited
to Sally to find himself the permanent guest of a duke, didn’t know
whether to be pleased or annoyed. The problems of his and Sally’s
existence were solved, it was true, but he wasn’t sure that he didn’t
prefer the problems. He rubbed his eyes. This was fantastic. It had no
relation to real life, which was the life of hard work and constant
progress in his cloister at Ananias. Also, its topsy-turviness
bewildered him. Here was the Duke, convinced that Sally had married
beneath her, and so unshakably convinced that Jocelyn had enormous
difficulty in not beginning to believe it too. He couldn’t help being
impressed by the Duke. He had never met a duke before, never come within
miles of meeting one, and was impressed. That first afternoon, when he
had been carried off in the Rolls Royce to Crippenham, he had spent the
time between luncheon and tea shut up in the old man’s study being
upbraided for having taken advantage, as he was severely told, of
Sally’s youth and inexperience and motherlessness to persuade her into a
marriage which was obviously socially disastrous for her; and he
couldn’t even if he had wished to, which he certainly didn’t, tell him
about Mr. Pinner, because he couldn’t get through the barrier of his
deafness. There the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_321">{321}</a></span> man had sat, with beetling brows and great
stern voice, booming away at him hour after hour, and there Jocelyn had
sat, young, helpless, silent, his forehead beaded with perspiration,
listening to a description, among other things, of the glories which
would have been Sally’s if he hadn’t inveigled her into marrying him.
And so sure was the Duke of his facts, and so indignant, that gradually
Jocelyn began to think there was something in it, and every moment felt
more of a blackguard. In the old man’s eyes, he asked himself, would
there be much difference between him and Pinner? And was there, in
anybody’s eyes, much difference? More education; that was all. But of
family, in the Duke’s sense, he had as little as Pinner, and if Pinner
had been to a decent school, as Jocelyn had, and then gone to
Cambridge&mdash;no, Oxford for Pinner&mdash;he would probably have cut quite as
good a figure, if not in science then in something else; perhaps as a
distinguished cleric.</p>

<p>He sat dumb and perspiring, feeling increasingly guilty; and if he could
have answered back he wouldn’t have, because the Duke made him feel
meek.</p>

<p>This meekness, however, didn’t last. It presently, after a period of
bewilderment, gave way to something very like resentment, which in its
turn developed into a growing conviction that he had become just a cat’s
paw,&mdash;he who, if left to himself, could have done almost anything.</p>

<p>Naturally he didn’t like this. But how, for the moment, could he help
it? Sally was going to have a baby. They had to live somewhere. It was
really heaven-sent, the whole thing. Yet&mdash;Sally, whom he had been going
to mould, was moulding him. Unconsciously; nothing to do with any
intention or desire of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_322">{322}</a></span> her own. And what she was moulding him into,
thought Jocelyn, as he drove himself backwards and forwards every day
between Crippenham and Cambridge, between his domestic life and his
work, between the strange mixture of emotions at the one end and the
clear peace and self-respect at the other, turning over in his mind with
knitted brows, as he drove, all that had happened to him in the brief
weeks since he had added Sally to his life&mdash;what she was moulding him
into was a cat’s paw.</p>

<p>Yes. Just that.</p>

<p>Were all husbands cat’s paws?</p>

<p>Probably, thought Jocelyn.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Mrs. Luke also reacted to the Moulsfords in terms of meekness. Hers,
however, lasted. She found them permanently dazzling. Besides, there was
nothing to be done. Jocelyn had gone; she had lost him for ever; he
would never come back, she very well knew, to the old life of dependence
on her. And if he must go, if she must lose him, there really was no one
in the world she would more willingly lose him to than the Duke of
Goring. For certainly it was a splendid, an exalted losing.</p>

<p>When she had had time to think after that visit from Lord Charles&mdash;he
had, she considered, a curious attractiveness&mdash;and was more herself
again, when she had recovered a little from the extreme misery she had
gone through and began not to feel quite so ill, she found it easy to
forgive her <i>mauvais quart d’heure</i>. The Moulsfords were heaping
benefits on her boy. They were settling all his difficulties. That
morning when she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_323">{323}</a></span> so unhappy, Lord Charles had been most
delightfully kind and sympathetic, and had told her that the Duke, his
father, intended to help the young couple,&mdash;‘You know my son won this
year’s Rutherford Prize,’ she had said. ‘Indeed I do,’ he had answered
in his charming, eager way, adding how much interested his father was in
the careers of brilliant young men, especially at Cambridge, helping
them in any way he could&mdash;and who would not, in such circumstances,
forgive?</p>

<p>Mrs. Luke forgave.</p>

<p>The fact, however, remained that she was now alone, and she couldn’t
think what her life was going to be without Jocelyn. For how, she
wondered, did one live without an object, with no <i>raison d’être</i> of any
sort? How did one live after one has left off being needed?</p>

<p>That year the spring was late and cold. The days dragged along, each one
emptier than the last. There was nothing in them at all; no reason,
hardly, why one should so much as get up every morning and dress for
days like that,&mdash;pithless, coreless, dead days. She tried to comfort
herself by remembering that at least she wasn’t any longer beaten down
and humiliated, that she could lift her head and look South Winch in the
face, and look it in the face more proudly than ever before; but even
that seemed to have lost its savour. Still, she mustn’t grumble. This
happened to all mothers sooner or later, this casting loose, this final
separation, and to none, she was sure, had it ever happened more
magnificently. She mustn’t grumble. She must be very thankful. She <i>was</i>
very thankful. Like Toussaint l’Ouverture&mdash;Wordsworth, again&mdash;she had,
she said to herself, sitting solitary through the chilly spring evenings
by her fire after yet another empty day, great allies; only<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_324">{324}</a></span> fortunately
of a different kind from poor Toussaint’s, for however highly one might
regard, theoretically, exultations and agonies and love and man’s
unconquerable mind, she, for her part, preferred the Moulsfords.</p>

<p>But did she?</p>

<p>A bleak little doubt crept into her mind. As the weeks passed, the doubt
grew bleaker. Invisible Moulsfords; Moulsfords delightful and most
friendly when one met them, but whom one never did meet; Moulsfords full
of almost intimacies; Moulsfords who said they were coming to see one
again, and didn’t come; Moulsfords benignant, but somewhere else: were
these in the long run, except as subjects of carefully modest
conversation in South Winch&mdash;and South Winch, curiously, while it was
plainly awe-struck by what had happened to Jocelyn yet was also
definitely less friendly than it used to be&mdash;were these in the long run
as life-giving, as satisfying, as fundamentally <i>filling</i> as Toussaint’s
exultations and agonies?</p>

<p>Ah, one had to <i>feel</i>; feel positively, feel acutely. Anything,
anything, any anger, any pain, any anxiety, any exasperation, anything
at all that stabbed one alive, was better than this awful numbness, this
empty, deadly, settled, stagnant, back-water calm....</p>

<p>And one evening, when it had been raining all day, after a period of
standing at the drawing-room window looking out at the dripping front
garden, where the almond-tree by the gate shivered in the grey twilight
like a frail, half-naked ghost, she turned and went to her
